            the Third's Island, called Otaheite, in the South Sea, with an account of the Discovery
            of several other Islands, and a description of their Inhabitants.</heading>
        <pb id="419"/><p>AS we continued our course to the westward, [day Sunday 12] after having
            cleared the Streight, we saw a great number of gannets, sheerwaters, pintado birds, and
            many others, about the ship, and had for the most part strong gales, hazy weather and
            heavy seas, so that we were frequently brought under our courses, and there was not a
            dry place in the ship for some weeks together.</p>
        <p>At eight in the morning of the 22d, [day Wednes. 22] we had an observa|tion, by which we
            found our longitude to be 95° 46′ W. and at noon, our latitude was 42° 24′ S. and the
            variation, by azimuth, 11° 6′ E.</p>
        <p>By the 24th, [day Friday 24] the men began to fall down very fast in colds and fevers, in
            consequence of the upper works being open, and their cloaths and beds continually
            wet.</p>
        <p>On the 26th, at four in the afternoon, the variation, [day Sunday 26] by azi|muth, [day
            Monday 27] was 10° 20′ E. and at six in the morning of the next day, it was 9° 8′ E. Our
            latitude, on the 27th at noon, was 36° 54′ S. our longitude, by account, 100° W. This
            day, the weather being moderate and fair, we dried all the people's cloaths, and got the
            sick upon deck, to whom we gave salop, <pb id="420"/>and wheat boiled with portable
            soup, every morning for breakfast, and all the ship's company had as much vinegar and
            mustard as they could use; portable soup was also con|stantly boiled in their pease and
            oatmeal.</p>
        <p>The hard gales, with frequent and violent squalls, and a heavy sea, soon returned, and
            continued with very little in|termission. The ship pitched so much, that we were afraid
            she would carry away her masts, and the men were again wet in their beds.</p>
        <p>On the 30th, [day Thursday 30] the variation, by azimuth, was 8° 30′ E. our latitude was
            32° 50′; longitude, by account, 100′ W. I began now to keep the ship to the northward,
            as we had no chance of getting westing in this latitude; and the surgeon was of opinion,
            that in a little time the sick would so much in|crease, that we should want hands to
            work the ship, if we could not get into better weather.</p>
        <p>On the third of May, [month May] [day Sunday 3] about four in the afternoon, we had an
            observation of the sun and moon, by which we found our longitude to be 96° 26′ W. the
            variation by the azimuth was 5° 44′ E. at six in the evening, [day Monday 4] and at six
            the next morning, it was 5° 58′ E. Our latitude, this day at noon, was 28° 20′ S. At
            four in the afternoon we had several observations for the longitude, and found it to be
            96° 21′ W.; at seven in the eve|ning, the variation was 6° 40′ E. by the azimuth, and
            the next morning at 10 it was, [day Tuesday 5] by amplitude, 5° 48′ E.; at three in the
            afternoon, the variation, by amplitude, was 7° 40′ E. This day we saw a tropic bird.</p>
        <p>At six o'clock in the morning, of Friday the eighth of May, [day Friday 8] the variation
            of the needle, by amplitude, was 7° 11′ E. In the afternoon we saw several sheerwaters
            and sea swal|lows. At eight in the morning of the 9th, [day Saturday 9] the variation by
                <pb id="421"/>azimuth was 6° 34′ E. and in the morning of the 11th, [day Monday 11]
            by azimuth and amplitude, it was 40° 40′ E. Our latitude was 27° 28′ S. longitude, by
            account, 106° W. This day, and the next, we saw several sea swallows, sheerwaters, [day
            Tuesday 12] and por|poises, about the ship.</p>
        <p>On the 14th of May, the variation, by four azimuths, [day Thursday 14] was 2° E. About
            four o'clock in the afternoon, we saw a large flock of brown birds, slying to the
            eastward, and something which had the appearance of high land, in the same quar|ter. We
            bore away for it till sun-set, and it still having the same appearance, we continued our
            course; but at two in the morning, having run 18 leagues without making it, we hauled
            the wind, and at day-light nothing was to be seen. We had now the satisfaction to find
            our ailing people mend apace. Our latitude was 24° 50′ S. our longitude, by ac|count,
            106° W. During all this time, we were looking out for the Swallow.</p>
        <p>At four in the afternoon of the 16th, the variation, [day Saturday 16] by azi|muth and
            amplitude, was 6° E. and at six the next morning, by four azimuths, it was 3° 20′.</p>
        <p>The carpenters were now employed in caulking the upper works of the ship, and repairing
            and painting the boats, and on the 18th, [day Monday 18] I gave a sheep among the people
            that were sick and recovering.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday the 20th, we found our longitude, [day Wednes. 20] by ob|servation, to be
            106° 47′ W. and our latitude 20° 52′ S.</p>
        <p>The next day we saw several flying fish, [day Thursday 21] which were the first we had
            seen in these seas.</p>
        <p>On the 22d, our longitude, by observation, [day Friday 22] was 111° W. and our latitude
            20° 18′ S. and this day we saw some bonet|toes, dolphins, and tropic birds.</p>
        <pb id="422"/><p>The people who had been recovering from colds and fevers, now began to fall
            down in the scurvy, upon which, at the surgeon's representation, wine was served to
            them: wort was also made for them of malt, and each man had half a pint of pickled
            cabbage every day. The variation from 4 to 5 E.</p>
        <p>On the 26th we saw two grampuses; on the 28th we saw another, [day Tuesday 26] [day
            Thursday 28] [day Friday 29] and the next day several birds, among which was one about
            the size of a swallow, which some of us thought was a land bird.</p>
        <p>Our men now began to look very pale and sickly, and to fall down very fast in the scurvy,
            notwithstanding all our care and attention to prevent it. They had vinegar and mustard
            without limitation, wine instead of spirits, sweet wort and salop. Portable soup was
            still constantly boiled in their peas and oatmeal; their birth and cloaths were kept
            perfectly clean; the hammocks were constantly brought upon the deck at eight o'clock in
            the morning, and carried down at four in the afternoon. Some of the beds and ham|mocks
            were washed every day; the water was rendered wholesome by ventilation, and every part
            between decks frequently washed with vinegar.</p>
        <p>On Sunday the 31st of May, [day Sunday 31] our longitude, by observation, was 127° 45′ W.
            our latitude 29° 38′ S. and the variation, by azimuth and amplitude, 5° 9′ E.</p>
        <p>The next day, [month June] [day Monday 1] at three in the afternoon, our longitude, by
            observation, was 129° 15′ W. and our latitude 19° 34′ S. We had squally weather, with
            much lightning and rain, and saw several men of war birds.</p>
        <p>On the 3d, [day Wednes 3] we saw several gannets, which, with the uncer|tainty of the
            weather, inclined us to hope that land was not <pb id="423"/>very far distant. [day
            Thursday 4] [day Friday 5] [day Saturday 6]The next day a turtle swam close by the ship;
            on the 5th we saw many birds, which confirmed our hope that some place of refreshment
            was near, and at 11 o'clock in the forenoon of the 6th, Jonathan Puller, a sea|man,
            called out from the mast-head, "Land in the W. N. W." At noon it was seen plainly from
            the deck, and found to be a low island, at about five or six leagues distance. The joy
            which every one on board felt at this discovery, can be con|ceived by those only who
            have experienced the danger, sick|ness, and fatigue of such a voyage as we had
            performed.</p>
        <p>When we were within about five miles of this island, we saw another, bearing N. W. by W.
            About three o'clock in the afternoon, being very near the island that was first
            dis|covered, we brought to, and I sent Mr. Faurneaux, my second lieutenant, my first
            lieutenant being very ill, with the boats manned and armed, to the shore. As he
            approached it, we saw two canoes put off, and paddle away with great expe|dition towards
            the island that lay to leeward. At seven in the evening the boats returned, and brought
            with them several cocoa nuts, and a considerable quantity of scurvy-grass; they brought
            also some fish hooks, that were made of oyster-shells, and some of the shells of which
            they were made. They reported that they had seen none of the inha|bitants, but had
            visited three huts, or rather sheds, consist|ing only of a roof, neatly thatched with
            cocoa nut and palm leaves, supported upon posts, and open all round. They saw also
            several canoes building, but found no fresh water, nor any fruit but cocoa nuts. They
            sounded, but found no an|chorage, and it was with great difficulty that they got on
            shore, as the surf ran very high. Having received this ac|count, I stood off and on all
            night, [day Whitsunday 7] and early the next morn|ing I sent the boats out again to
            sound, with orders, if possible, to find a place where the ship might come to an <pb
                id="424"/>anchor; [day Whitsunday 7] but at 11 o'clock they returned, with no better
            suc|cess than before. The people told me that the whole island was surrounded by a reef,
            and that although on the weather side of the island there was an opening through it,
            into a large bason, that extended to the middle of the island, yet they found it so full
            of breakers, that they could not venture in; neither indeed had they been able to land
            on any part of the island, the surf running still higher than it had done the day
            before. As it would therefore answer no purpose to con|tinue here, I hoisted the boats
            in, and stood away for the other island, which bore S. 22° E. distant about four
            leagues. The island which I now quitted, having been discovered on Whitsun-eve, I called
            it WHITSUN ISLAND. [place Whitsun-island] It is about four miles long, and three wide.
            Its latitude is 19° 26′ S. and its longitude, by observation, 137° 56′ W.</p>
        <p>When we came under the lee of the other island, I sent Lieutenant Furneaux, with the
            boats manned and armed, to the shore, where I saw about fifty of the natives armed with
            long pikes, and several of them running about with fire|brands in their hands. I ordered
            Mr. Furneaux to go to that part of the beach where we saw the people, and endeavour to
            traffick with them for fruit and water, or whatever else might be useful; at the same
            time, being particularly careful to give them no offence. I ordered him also to employ
            the boats in sounding for anchorage. About seven o'clock he returned, and told me that
            he could find no ground with the line, till he came within half a cable's length of the
            shore, and that there it consisted of sharp rocks, and lay very deep.</p>
        <p>As the boat approached the shore, the Indians thronged down towards the beach, and put
            themselves upon their guard with their long pikes, as if to dispute the landing. Our men
            then lay upon their oars, and made signs of friend|ship, <pb id="425"/>shewing at the
            same time several strings of beads, [day Whitsunday 7] ribands, knives, and other
            trinkets. The Indians still made signs to our people that they should depart, but at the
            same time eyed the trinkets with a kind of wishful curiosity. Soon after some of them
            advanced a few steps into the sea, and our people making signs that they wanted cocoa
            nuts and water, some of them brought down a small quantity of both, and ventured to hand
            them into the boat: the water was in cocoa nut-shells, and the fruit was stripped of its
            out|ward covering, which is probably used for various purposes. For this supply they
            were paid with the trinkets that had been shewed them, and some nails, upon which they
            seemed to set a much greater value. During this traffick, one of the Indians found means
            to steal a silk handkerchief, in which some of our small merchandize was wrapped up, and
            carried it clear off, with its contents, so dexterously, that no body observed him. Our
            people made signs that a hand|kerchief had been stolen, but they either could not, or
            would not understand them. The boat continued about the beach, sounding for anchorage,
            till it was dark; and having many times endeavoured to persuade the natives to bring
            down some scurvy-grass, without success, she returned on board.</p>
        <p>I stood off and on with the ship all night, [day Monday 8] and as soon as the day broke,
            I sent the boats again, with orders to make a landing, but without giving any offence to
            the natives, that could possibly be avoided. When our boats came near the shore, the
            officer was greatly surprised to see seven large canoes, with two stout masts in each,
            lying just in the surf, with all the inhabitants upon the beach, ready to embark. They
            made signs to our people to go higher up; they readily complied, and as soon as they
            went ashore, all the Indians embarked, and sailed away to the westward, being joined <pb
                id="426"/>by two other canoes at the west end of the island. [day Monday 8] About
            noon, the boats returned, laden with cocoa nuts, palm nuts, and scurvy-grass. Mr.
            Furneaux, who commanded the ex|pedition, told me that the Indians had left nothing
            behind them but four or five canoes. He found a well of very good water, and described
            the island as being sandy and level, full of trees, but without underwood, and abounding
            with scurvy-grass. The canoes, which steered about W. S. W. as long as they could be
            seen from the mast-head, appeared to be about thirty feet long, four feet broad, and
            three and an half deep. Two of these being brought along side of each other, were
            fastened together, at the distance of about three feet asunder, by cross beams, passing
            from the larboard gunwale of one, to the starboard gunwale of the other, in the middle
            and near to each end.</p>
        <p>The inhabitants of this island were of a middle stature, and dark complexion, with long
            black hair, which hung loose over their shoulders. The men were well made, and the
            wo|men handsome. Their cloathing was a kind of coarse cloth or matting, which was
            fastened about their middle, and seemed capable of being brought up round their
            shoulders</p>. <p>In the afternoon, I sent Lieutenant Furneaux with the boats again on
            shore. He had with him a mate and twenty men, who were to make a rolling way for getting
            the casks down to the beach from the well. I gave orders that he should take possession
            of the island, in the name of King George the Third, and give it the name of QUEEN
            CHAR|LOTTE's ISLAND, [place Queen Char|lotte's Island] in honour of her Majesty. The
            boats re|turned freighted with cocoa nuts and scurvy-grass, and the officer told me that
            he had found two more wells of good water, not far from the beach. I was at this time
            very ill, yet I went ashore with the Surgeon, and several of the people, <pb id="427"
            />who were enfeebled by the scurvy, to take a walk. [day Monday 8] I found the wells so
            convenient, that I left the mate and twenty men on shore to fill water, and ordered a
            week's provisions to be sent them from the ship, they being already furnished with arms
            and ammunition. In the evening I returned on board, with the Surgeon and the sick,
            leaving only the waterers on shore. As we had not been able to find any anchorage, I
            stood off and on all night.</p>
        <p>In the morning, [day Tuesday 9] I sent all the empty water casks on shore: the Surgeon
            and the sick were also sent for the benefit of another airing, but I gave them strict
            orders that they should keep near the water-side, and in the shade; that they should not
            pull down or injure any of the houses, nor, for the sake of the fruit, destroy the cocoa
            trees, which I ap|pointed proper persons to climb. At noon, the rolling-way being made,
            the cutter returned laden with water, but it was with great difficulty got off the
            beach, as it is all rock, and the surf that breaks upon it, is often very great. At
            four, I received another boat-load of water, and a fresh supply of cocoa nuts, palm
            nuts, and scurvy-grass; the Sur|geon also returned with the sick men, who received much
            benefit from their walk. The next morning, [day Wednes. 10] as soon as it was light, I
            dispatched orders to the mate, to send all the water that was filled on board, and to be
            ready to come off with his people when the boats should return again, bring|ing with
            them as many cocoa nuts, and as much scurvy-grass as they could procure. About eight
            o'clock, all the boats and people came on board, with the water and refresh|ments, but
            the cutter, in coming off, shipped a sea, which almost filled her with water: the barge
            was happily near enough to assist her, by taking great part of her crew on board, while
            the rest freed her, without any other damage than the loss of the cocoa nuts, and greens
            that were on <pb id="428"/>board. [day Wednes. 10] At noon, I hoisted the boats in, and
            there being a great sea, with a dreadful surf rolling in upon the shore, and no
            anchorage, I thought it prudent to leave this place, with such refreshments as we had
            got. The people who had resided on shore, saw no appearance of metal of any kind, but
            several tools, which were made of shells and stones, sharpened and fitted into handles,
            like adzes, chissels, and awls. They saw several canoes building, which are formed of
            planks, sewed together, and fastened to several small timbers, that pass transversely
            along the bottom and up the sides. They saw several repositories of the dead, in which
            the body was left to putrefy under a canopy, and not put into the ground.</p>
        <p>When we sailed, we left a union jack flying upon the island, with the ship's name, the
            time of our being here, and an account of our taking possession of this place, and
            Whitsun Island, in the name of his Britannic Majesty, cut on a piece of wood, and in the
            bark of several trees. We also left some hatchets, nails, glass bottles, beads,
            shillings, six|pences, and halfpence, as presents to the natives, and an atonement for
            the disturbance we had given them. Queen Charlotte's Island is about six miles long, and
            one mile wide, lies in latitude 19° 18′ S. longitude, by observation, 138° 4′ W. and we
            found the variation here to be 4° 46′ E.</p>
        <p>We made sail with a fine breeze, and about one o'clock, saw an island W. by S. Queen
            Charlotte's Island, at this time bearing E. by N. distant 15 miles. At half an hour
            after three, we were within about three quarters of a mile of the east end of the
            island, and ran close along the shore, but had no soundings. The east and west ends are
            joined to each other by a reef of rocks, over which the sea breaks into a lagoon, in the
            middle of the island, which, therefore, had <pb id="429"/>the appearance of two islands,
            [day Wednes. 10] and seemed to be about six miles long, and four broad. The whole of it
            is low land, full of trees, but we saw not a single cocoa nut, nor any huts: we found,
            however, at the westermost end, all the canoes and people who had fled, at our approach,
            from Queen Charlotte's Island, and some more. We counted eight double canoes, and about,
            fourscore people, men, women, and children. The canoes were drawn upon the beach, the
            women and children were placed near them, and the men advanced with their pikes and
            firebrands, making a great noise, and dancing in a strange manner. We observed that this
            island was sandy, and that under the trees there was no verdure. As the shore was every
            where rocky, as there was no anchorage, and as we had no prospect of obtaining any
            refreshment here, I set sail at six o'clock in the evening, from this island, to which I
            gave the name of EGMONT ISLAND, [place Egmont Island] in honour of the Earl of Egmont,
            who was then first Lord of the Admiralty. It lies in latitude 19° 20′ S. lon|gitude, by
            observation, 138° 30′ W.</p>
        <p>At one o'clock, on the 11th, [day Thursday 11] we saw an island in the W. S. W. and stood
            for it. At four in the afternoon, we were within a quarter of a mile of the shore, and
            ran along it, sounding continually, but could get no ground. It is sur|rounded on every
            side by rocks, on which the sea breaks very high. It is full of trees, but not one cocoa
            nut, and has much the same appearance with Egmont island, but is much narrower. Among
            the rocks, at the west end, we saw about sixteen of the natives, but no canoes: they
            carried long pikes or poles in their hands, and seemed to be, in every respect, the same
            kind of people that we had seen before. As nothing was to be had here, and it blew very
            hard, I made sail till eight in the evening, and then brought to. To this island, which
            is about six miles long, and from <pb id="430"/>one mile to one quarter of a mile broad,
            I gave the name of GLOUCESTER ISLAND, [place Gloucester Island] in honour of his Royal
            Highness the Duke. It lies in latitude 19° 11′ S. and longitude, by obser|vation, 140°
            4′ W.</p>
        <p>At five o'clock in the morning, [day Friday 12] we made sail, and soon after saw another
            island. At 10 o'clock, the weather being tempestuous, with much rain, we saw a long
            reef, with breakers on each side of the island, and therefore brought the ship to, with
            her head off the shore. To this island, which lies in latitude 19° 18′ S. longitude, by
            observation, 140° 36′ W. I gave the name of CUMBERLAND ISLAND, [place Cumberland Island]
            in honour of his Royal Highness the Duke. It lies low, and is about the same size as
            Queen Charlotte's Island. We found the variation of the needle here to be 7° 10′ E. As I
            had no hope of finding any refreshment here, I stood on to the west|ward.</p>
        <p>At day-break, on Saturday the 13th, [day Saturday 13] we saw another small low island, in
            the N. N. W. right to windward. It had the appearance of small flat keys. This place I
            called PRINCE WILLIAM HENRY's ISLAND, [place Prince Wil|liam Henry's Island] in honour
            of his Majesty's third son. It lies in latitude 19° S. longitude, by observation, 141°
            6′ W. I made no stay here, hoping, that to the west|ward I should find higher land,
            where the ship might come to an anchor, and such refreshments as we wanted be
            pro|cured.</p>
        <p>Soon after day-light, on the 17th, [day Wednes. 17] we saw land bearing W. by N. and
            making in a small round hummock. At noon, when it bore N. 64. W. distant about five
            leagues, its appearance greatly resembled the Mewstone in Plymouth Sound, but it seemed
            to be much larger. We found the ship this day, 20 miles to the northward of her
            reckoning, which I imputed to a great S. W. swell.</p>
        <pb id="431"/><p>At five in the evening, [day Wednes. 17] this island bore N. W. distant
            about eight miles. I then hauled the wind, and stood on and off all night. At ten, we
            saw a light upon the shore, which, though the island was small, proved that it was
            in|habited, and gave us hopes that we should find anchorage near it. We observed with
            great pleasure, that the land was very high, and covered with cocoa trees; a sure sign
            that there was water.</p>
        <p>The next morning, [day Thursday 18] I sent Lieutenant Furneaux to the shore, with the
            boats manned and armed, and all kinds of trinkets, to establish a traffick with the
            natives, for such re|freshment as the place would afford. I gave him orders also to
            find, if possible, an anchoring place for the ship. While we were getting out the boats,
            several canoes put off from the island, but as soon as the people on board saw them make
            towards the shore, they put back. At noon, the boats re|turned, and brought with them a
            pig and a cock, with a few plantains and cocoa nuts. Mr. Furneaux reported, that he had
            seen at least an hundred of the inhabitants, and believed there were many more upon the
            island; but that having been all round it, he could find no anchorage, nor scarcely a
            landing-place for the boat. When he reached the shore, he came to a grapling, and threw
            a warp to the Indians upon the beach, who caught it and held it fast. He then began to
            converse with them by signs, and observed that they had no weapon among them, but that
            some of them had white sticks, which seemed to be ensigns of authority, as the people
            who bore them kept the rest of the natives back. In return for the pig and the cock, he
            gave them some beads, a looking-glass, a few combs, with several other trinkets, and a
            hatchet. The women, who had been kept at a distance, as soon as they saw the trinkets,
            ran down in a croud to the beach, with great eagerness, but were soon driven away by <pb
                id="432"/>the men, [day Thursday 18] at which they expressed much disappointment and
            vexation. While this traffick was carrying on, a man came secretly round a rock, and
            diving down, took up the boat's grappling, and at the same time, the people on shore who
            held the warp, made an effort to draw her into the surf. As soon as this was perceived
            by the people on board, they fixed a musket over the man's head who had taken up the
            grappling, upon which he instantly let it go, with marks of great terror and
            astonishment; the people on shore also let go the rope. The boats after this, lay some
            time upon their oars, but the officer finding that he could get nothing more, returned
            on board. Mr. Furneaux told me that both the men and women were cloathed, and he brought
            a piece of their cloth away with him. The inhabitants appeared to him to be more
            numerous than the island could support, and for this reason, especially as he saw some
            large double canoes upon the beach, he imagined there were islands of larger extent, not
            far distant, where refreshments in greater plenty might be procured, and hoped that they
            might be less difficult of access. As I thought this a reasonable conjecture, I hoisted
            in the boats, and determined to run farther to the westward. To this place, which is
            nearly circular, and about two miles over, I gave the name of OSNABURGH ISLAND, [place
            Osnaburgh Island] in honour of Prince Frederick, who is bishop of that see. It lies in
            latitude 17° 51′ S. and longitude 147° 30′ W.; the variation here was 7° 10′ E.</p>
