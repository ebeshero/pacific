         <span class="animalsighting">AS we continued
                            our course to the westward, after having cleared the Streight, we
                        saw a great number of gannets, sheerwaters, pintado birds, and many
                        others,</span> about the ship, <span class="weather">and had for
                        the most part strong gales, hazy weather and heavy seas,</span> so that we
                    were frequently brought under our courses, and there was not a dry place in the
                    ship for some weeks together.</p>
                <p>At eight in the morning
                    of the 22d, we had an observation, by which we
                    found our longitude to be <span class="geo">95° 46′ W</span>. and at noon,
                    our latitude was <span class="geo">42° 24′ S</span>. and the variation, by
                    azimuth, 11° 6′ E.</p>
                <p>By the 24th, <span class="health">the
                        men began to fall down very fast in colds and fevers,</span> in consequence of
                    the upper works being open, and their cloaths and beds continually wet.</p>
                <p>On the 26th, at four in the
                        afternoon, the variation, by azimuth, was 10° 20′ E. and at six in the morning
                    of the next day, it was 9° 8′ E. Our latitude, on
                    the 27th at noon, was <span class="geo">36° 54′
                        S</span>. our longitude, by account, <span class="geo">100° W</span>. <span class="health">This day, the
                        weather being moderate and fair, we dried all the people's cloaths, and got
                        the sick upon deck, to whom we gave salop,</span>
                    <em>--page 420--
        </em>and <span class="food">wheat boiled with portable soup,
                        every morning for breakfast</span>, and <span class="food">all the
                        ship's company had as much vinegar and mustard as they could use; portable
                        soup was also constantly boiled in their pease and oatmeal</span>.</p>
                <p>
         <span class="storm">
            <span class="weather">The hard gales,
                            with frequent and violent squalls, and a heavy sea, soon returned, and
                            continued with very little intermission.</span> The ship pitched so much,
                        that we were afraid she would carry away her masts, and <span class="food">the men were again wet in their beds</span>
         </span>.</p>
                <p>On the 30th, the variation, by azimuth, was 8° 30′
                    E. our latitude was <span class="geo">32° 50′</span>; longitude, by account, <span class="geo">100′ W</span>. I began now to keep the ship to the northward, as
                    we had no chance of getting westing in this latitude; and <span class="health">the surgeon was of opinion, that in a little time the sick
                        would so much increase, that we should want hands to work the ship, if we
                        could not get into better weather</span>.</p>
                <p>On the third of May, about four in the afternoon, we had an observation of the sun and moon, by
                    which we found our longitude to be <span class="geo">96° 26′ W</span>. the
                    variation by the azimuth was 5° 44′ E. at six in the
                        evening, and at six
                    the next morning, it was <span class="geo">5° 58′
                        E</span>. Our latitude, this day
                    at noon, was <span class="geo">28° 20′ S</span>. At
                        four in the afternoon we had several
                    observations for the longitude, and found it to be <span class="geo">96° 21′
                        W</span>.; at seven in the evening, the
                    variation was 6° 40′ E. by the azimuth, and the next
                        morning
                    at 10 it was, by amplitude, 5° 48′ E.; at three in the afternoon, the variation, by amplitude,
                    was 7° 40′ E. This day
                    <span class="animalsighting">we saw a tropic bird</span>.</p>
                <p>At six o'clock in the morning, of Friday the eighth of May, the variation of the
                    needle, by amplitude, was 7° 11′ E. In the afternoon <span class="animalsighting">we saw several sheerwaters and sea swallows.</span>
                    At eight in the morning of the 9th,  the variation by <em>--page 421--
        </em>azimuth was 6° 34′ E. and
                    in the morning of the 11th, by azimuth and
                    amplitude, it was 40° 40′ E. Our latitude was <span class="geo">27° 28′ S</span>. longitude, by account,
                        <span class="geo">106° W</span>. This day, and the next, <span class="animalsighting">we saw several sea swallows, sheerwaters, and
                        porpoises</span>, about the ship.</p>
                <p>On the 14th of May, the variation, by four
                    azimuths, was 2° E. About four o'clock in the
                        afternoon, <span class="animalsighting">we saw a large
                        flock of brown birds, slying to the eastward,</span> and something which had
                    the appearance of high land, in the same quarter. We bore away for it till
                    sun-set, and it still having the same appearance, we continued our course; but
                    at two in the morning, having run 18 leagues
                    without making it, we hauled the wind, and at day-light nothing was to be seen. We had now the satisfaction to
                    find our ailing people mend apace. Our latitude was <span class="geo">24° 50′
                        S</span>. our longitude, by account, <span class="geo">106° W</span>. During all this time, we were
                    looking out for the Swallow.</p>
                <p>At four in the afternoon of the 16th, the variation, by azimuth and amplitude, was 6° E. and at
                        six the next
                        morning, by four azimuths, it was 3° 20′.</p>
                <p>
         <span class="repair">The carpenters were now employed in caulking the
                        upper works of the ship, and repairing and painting the boats,</span> and
                        on the 18th, <span class="health">I gave a sheep among the people that were sick and recovering.</span>
      </p>
                <p>On Wednesday the 20th, we found our longitude, by
                    observation, to be <span class="geo">106° 47′ W</span>. and our latitude <span class="geo">20° 52′ S</span>.</p>
                <p>The next day we saw several flying fish, which
                    were the first we had seen in these seas.</p>
                <p>On the 22d, our longitude, by observation, was
                        <span class="geo">111° W</span>. and our latitude <span class="geo">20° 18′
                        S</span>. and this day <span class="animalsighting">we saw some
                        bonettoes, dolphins, and tropic birds.</span>

                        was rendered wholesome by ventilation, and every part between decks
                        frequently washed with vinegar.</span>

                <p>On Sunday the 31st of May, our longitude, by
                    observation, was <span class="geo">127° 45′ W</span>. our latitude <span class="geo">29° 38′ S</span>. and the variation, by azimuth and amplitude,
                    5° 9′ E.</p>
                <p>The next day, at three in
                        the afternoon, our longitude, by observation, was <span class="geo">129° 15′ W</span>. and our latitude <span class="geo">19° 34′ S</span>. We had squally weather, with much lightning
                        and rain,
                    <span class="animalsighting">and saw several men of war
                    birds.</span>
      </p>
                <p>On the 3d, we saw <span class="animalsighting">several gannets</span>, which, with the uncertainty
                    of the weather, inclined us to hope that land was not <em>--page 423--
        </em>very far
                    distant. The next day
                    <span class="animalsighting">a turtle swam close by the ship;</span>
                    on the 5th
                    <span class="animalsighting">we saw many birds,</span> which confirmed
                    our hope that some place of refreshment was near, and at 11 o'clock in the forenoon of the
                    6th, <span class="landsighting">Jonathan
                            Puller, a seaman, called out from the mast-head, "Land in the
                        W. N. W." At noon it was seen plainly from the
                        deck, and found to be a low island, at about five or six leagues distance.
                        The joy which every one on board felt at this discovery, can be conceived by
                        those only who have experienced the danger, sickness, and fatigue of such a
                        voyage as we had performed</span>.</p>
                <p>
         <span class="landsighting">When we were within about five miles of
                        this island, we saw another, bearing N. W. by W</span>. About three o'clock in the afternoon, being very near the
                    island that was first discovered, we brought to, and I sent Mr.
                        Faurneaux, my second lieutenant, my first lieutenant being very
                    ill, with the boats manned and armed, to the shore. As he approached it, we saw
                    two canoes put off, and paddle away with great expedition towards the island
                    that lay to leeward. <span class="island">At
                            seven in the evening the boats returned, <span class="provisions">and brought with them several cocoa nuts, and a
                            considerable quantity of scurvy-grass;</span>
                        <span class="object">they brought also some fish hooks, that
                            were made of oyster-shells, and some of the shells of which they were
                            made</span>
         </span>. They reported that <span class="natives">they had seen none of the inhabitants, but had visited three
                        huts, or rather sheds, consisting only of a roof, neatly thatched with cocoa
                        nut and palm leaves, supported upon posts, and open all round. They saw also
                        several canoes building</span>, but found no fresh water, nor any fruit but
                    cocoa nuts. They sounded, but found no anchorage, and it was with great
                    difficulty that they got on shore, as the surf ran very high. Having received
                    this account, I stood off and on all night, and early
                        the next morning I sent the boats out again to sound, with orders, if
                    possible, to find a place where the ship might come to an <em>--page 424--
        </em>anchor;
                    but at 11 o'clock they returned, with no better
                    success than before. The people told me that the whole island was surrounded by
                    a reef, and that although on the weather side of the island there was an opening
                    through it, into a large bason, that extended to the middle of the island, yet
                    they found it so full of breakers, that they could not venture in; neither
                    indeed had they been able to land on any part of the island, the surf running
                    still higher than it had done the day before. As it would therefore answer no
                    purpose to continue here, I hoisted the boats in, and stood away for the other
                    island, which bore S. 22° E. distant about four leagues. The island which I now
                    quitted, having been discovered on Whitsun-eve, <span class="place">I called it WHITSUN ISLAND. It is
                        about four miles long, and three wide. Its latitude is <span class="geo">19°
                            26′ S</span>. and its longitude, by observation, <span class="geo">137°
                            56′ W</span>.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="scout">When we came under the lee of the other island, I sent Lieutenant
                        Furneaux, with the boats manned and armed, to the shore, where I
                    saw about fifty of the natives armed with long pikes, and several of them
                    running about with firebrands in their hands. I ordered Mr.
                        Furneaux to go to that part of the beach where we saw the people,
                    and endeavour to traffick with them for fruit and water, or whatever else might
                    be useful; at the same time, being particularly careful to give them no offence.
                    I ordered him also to employ the boats in sounding for anchorage. About seven
                    o'clock he returned, and told me that he could find no ground with the line,
                    till he came within half a cable's length of the shore, and that there it
                    consisted of sharp rocks, and lay very deep.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="natives">As the boat approached the
                        shore, the Indians thronged down towards the beach, and put themselves upon
                        their guard with their long pikes, as if to dispute the landing.</span>
         <span class="natives">Our men then lay upon their
                        oars, and made signs of friendship, <em>--page 425--
        </em>shewing at the same time
                        several strings of beads, ribands, knives, and other trinkets. The Indians
                        still made signs to our people that they should depart, but at the same time
                        eyed the trinkets with a kind of wishful curiosity. Soon after some of them
                        advanced a few steps into the sea, and our people making signs that they
                        wanted cocoa nuts and water, some of them brought down a small quantity of
                        both, and ventured to hand them into the boat: the water was in cocoa
                        nut-shells, and the fruit was stripped of its outward covering, which is
                        probably used for various purposes. For this supply they were paid with the
                        trinkets that had been shewed them, and some nails, upon which they seemed
                        to set a much greater value.</span>
                    <span class="natives">During this traffick, one of the
                        Indians found means to steal a silk handkerchief, in which some of our small
                        merchandize was wrapped up, and carried it clear off, with its contents, so
                        dexterously, that no body observed him. Our people made signs that a
                        handkerchief had been stolen, but they either could not, or would not
                        understand them.</span> The boat continued about the beach, sounding for
                    anchorage, till it was dark; and having many times endeavoured to persuade the
                    natives to bring down some scurvy-grass, without success, she returned on
                    board.</p>
                <p>I stood off and on with the ship all night, and as soon as the day broke, I sent the boats again, with orders
                    to make a landing, but without giving any offence to the natives, that could
                    possibly be avoided. <span class="natives">When our
                        boats came near the shore, the officer was greatly surprised to see seven
                        large canoes, with two stout masts in each, lying just in the surf, with all
                        the inhabitants upon the beach, ready to embark. They made signs to our
                        people to go higher up; they readily complied, and as soon as they went
                        ashore, all the Indians embarked, and sailed away to the westward, being
                        joined <em>--page 426--
        </em>by two other canoes at the west end of the island.</span>
                    About noon, <span class="provisions">the boats returned, laden with cocoa nuts, palm nuts, and
                        scurvy-grass.</span>
                    Mr. Furneaux, who commanded the expedition, told me that
                    the Indians had left nothing behind them but four or five canoes. He found a
                    well of very good water, and described the island as being sandy and level, full
                    of trees, but without underwood, and abounding with scurvy-grass. <span class="natives">The canoes,
                    which steered about W. S. W. as long as they could be seen from the mast-head,
                    appeared to be about thirty feet long, four feet broad, and three and an half
                    deep. Two of these being brought along side of each other, were fastened
                    together, at the distance of about three feet asunder, by cross beams, passing
                    from the larboard gunwale of one, to the starboard gunwale of the other, in the
                    middle and near to each end.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="natives">The inhabitants of this island
                        were of a middle stature, and dark complexion, with long black hair, which
                        hung loose over their shoulders. The men were well made, and the women
                        handsome. Their cloathing was a kind of coarse cloth or matting, which was
                        fastened about their middle, and seemed capable of being brought up round
                        their shoulders.</span>
      </p>
                <p>In the afternoon, I sent Lieutenant Furneaux with the boats
                    again on shore. He had with him a mate and twenty men, who were to make a
                    rolling way for getting the casks down to the beach from the well. I gave orders
                    that he should take possession of the island, in the name of King
                        George the Third, and give it the name of QUEEN
                        CHARLOTTE's ISLAND, in honour of her Majesty. <span class="provisions">The boats returned freighted with cocoa nuts and
                        scurvy-grass, and the officer told me that he had found two more wells of
                        good water, not far from the beach.</span>
                    <span class="health">I was at this time very ill, yet I went
                        ashore with the Surgeon, and several of the people, <em>--page 427--
        </em>who were
                        enfeebled by the scurvy, to take a walk.</span> I found the wells so
                    convenient, that I left the mate and twenty men on shore to fill water, and
                    ordered a week's provisions to be sent them from the ship, they being already
                    furnished with arms and ammunition. In the evening I returned on board, with the
                    Surgeon and the sick, leaving only the waterers on shore. As we had not been
                    able to find any anchorage, I stood off and on all night.</p>
                <p>In the morning, I sent all the empty water casks
                    on shore: the Surgeon and the sick were also sent for the benefit of another
                    airing, but I gave them strict orders that they should keep near the water-side,
                    and in the shade; that they should not pull down or injure any of the houses,
                    nor, for the sake of the fruit, destroy the cocoa trees, which I appointed
                    proper persons to climb. At noon, the rolling-way
                    being made, the cutter returned laden with water, but it was with great
                    difficulty got off the beach, as it is all rock, and the surf that breaks upon
                    it, is often very great. At four, <span class="provisions">I received another boat-load of water, and a fresh
                        supply of cocoa nuts, palm nuts, and scurvy-grass;</span>
                    <span class="health">the Surgeon also returned with the sick men,
                        who received much benefit from their walk.</span>
                    The next morning, as soon as it was light, <span class="provisions">I dispatched orders to the mate, to send
                        all the water that was filled on board, and to be ready to come off with his
                        people when the boats should return again, bringing with them as many cocoa
                        nuts, and as much scurvy-grass as they could procure. About eight o'clock,
                        all the boats and people came on board, with the water and refreshments, but
                        the cutter, in coming off, shipped a sea, which almost filled her with
                        water: the barge was happily near enough to assist her, by taking great part
                        of her crew on board, while the rest freed her, without any other damage
                        than the loss of the cocoa nuts, and greens that were on <em>--page 428--
        </em>board.</span>
                    At noon, I hoisted the boats in, and there being a
                    great sea, with a dreadful surf rolling in upon the shore, and no anchorage, I
                    thought it prudent to leave this place, with such refreshments as we had got.
                        <span class="natives">The people who had resided
                        on shore, saw no appearance of metal of any kind, but several tools, which
                        were made of shells and stones, sharpened and fitted into handles, like
                        adzes, chissels, and awls. They saw several canoes building, which are
                        formed of planks, sewed together, and fastened to several small timbers,
                        that pass transversely along the bottom and up the sides.</span>
                    <span class="natives">They saw several repositories of the dead,
                        in which the body was left to putrefy under a canopy, and not put into the
                        ground.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="contact">When we sailed, we left a union jack flying
                        upon the island, with the ship's name, the time of our being here, and an
                        account of our taking possession of this place, and Whitsun Island, in the
                        name of his Britannic Majesty, cut on a piece of wood, and in the bark of
                        several trees.We also left some hatchets, nails, glass bottles, beads,
                        shillings, sixpences, and halfpence, as presents to the natives, and an
                        atonement for the disturbance we had given them.</span>
                    Queen Charlotte's Island is about six miles long, and one
                    mile wide, lies in latitude <span class="geo">19° 18′ S</span>. longitude, by
                    observation, <span class="geo">138° 4′ W</span>. and we found the variation here
                    to be 4° 46′ E.</p>
                <p>We made sail with a fine breeze, and about one
                        o'clock, <span class="landsighting">saw an island</span> W.
                    by S. Queen Charlotte's Island, at this time bearing E.
                    by N. distant 15 miles. At half an hour after
                    three, we were within about three quarters of a mile of the east end of
                    the island, and ran close along the shore, but had no soundings. The east and
                    west ends are joined to each other by a reef of rocks, over which the sea breaks
                    into a lagoon, in the middle of the island, which, therefore, had <em>--page 429--
        </em>the appearance of two islands, and seemed to be about six miles long, and four
                    broad. The whole of it is low land, full of trees, but we saw not a single cocoa
                    nut, nor any huts: <span class="natives">we found,
                        however, at the westermost end, all the canoes and people who had fled, at
                        our approach, from Queen Charlotte's Island, and some
                        more. We counted eight double canoes, and about, fourscore people, men,
                        women, and children. The canoes were drawn upon the beach, the women and
                        children were placed near them, and the men advanced with their pikes and
                        firebrands, making a great noise, and dancing in a strange manner.</span> We
                    observed that this island was sandy, and that under the trees there was no
                    verdure. As the shore was every where rocky, as there was no anchorage, and as
                    we had no prospect of obtaining any refreshment here, I set sail at six o'clock in the evening, from this island, to
                    which I gave the name of EGMONT ISLAND, in honour of the
                    Earl of Egmont, who was then first Lord of the Admiralty. It lies in latitude
                        <span class="geo">19° 20′ S</span>. longitude, by observation, <span class="geo">138° 30′ W</span>.</p>
                <p>At one o'clock, on the
                        11th, <span class="landsighting">we saw an island</span> in
                    the W. S. W. and stood for it. At four in the
                        afternoon, we were within a quarter of a mile of the shore, and ran
                    along it, sounding continually, but could get no ground. It is surrounded on
                    every side by rocks, on which the sea breaks very high. It is full of trees, but
                    not one cocoa nut, and has much the same appearance with Egmont
                        island, but is much narrower. <span class="natives">Among the rocks, at the west end, we saw
                        about sixteen of the natives, but no canoes: they carried long pikes or
                        poles in their hands, and seemed to be, in every respect, the same kind of
                        people that we had seen before.</span> As nothing was to be had here, and it
                    blew very hard, I made sail till eight in the
                        evening, and then brought to. To this island, which is about six
                    miles long, and from <em>--page 430--
        </em>one mile to one quarter of a mile broad, I
                    gave the name of GLOUCESTER ISLAND, in honour of his
                    Royal Highness the Duke. It lies in latitude <span class="geo">19° 11′ S</span>.
                    and longitude, by observation, <span class="geo">140° 4′ W</span>.</p>
                <p>At five o'clock in the morning, we made sail, <span class="landsighting">and soon after saw another island</span>.
                        At 10 o'clock,<span class="weather"> the weather being tempestuous, with much rain,</span> we saw a long reef,
                    with breakers on each side of the island, and therefore brought the ship to,
                    with her head off the shore. To this island, which lies in latitude <span class="geo">19° 18′ S</span>. longitude, by observation, <span class="geo">140° 36′ W</span>. I gave the name of CUMBERLAND
                        ISLAND, in honour of his Royal Highness the Duke. It lies low,
                    and is about the same size as Queen Charlotte's Island.
                    We found the variation of the needle here to be 7° 10′ E. As I had no hope of
                    finding any refreshment here, I stood on to the westward.</p>
                <p>At day-break, on Saturday the 13th, <span class="landsighting">we saw another small low island, in
                    the N. N. W. right to windward. It had the appearance of small flat keys.</span> This
                    place I called PRINCE WILLIAM HENRY's ISLAND, in honour
                    of his Majesty's third son. It lies in latitude <span class="geo">19° S</span>.
                    longitude, by observation, <span class="geo">141° 6′ W</span>. I made no stay
                    here, hoping, that to the westward I should find higher land, where the ship
                    might come to an anchor, and such refreshments as we wanted be procured.</p>
                <p>Soon after day-light, on the 17th, <span class="landsighting">we saw land bearing W. by N. and making in a small
                        round hummock.</span>
                    At noon, when it bore N. 64. W. distant about five
                    leagues, its appearance greatly resembled the Mewstone in Plymouth Sound, but it
                    seemed to be much larger. We found the ship this day, 20 miles to the northward
                    of her reckoning, which I imputed to a great S. W. swell.</p>
                <em>--page 431--
        </em>
                <p>At five in the evening, this island bore N. W.
                    distant about eight miles. I then hauled the wind, and stood on and off all
                    night. At ten, we saw a light upon the shore,
                    which, though the island was small, proved that it was inhabited, and gave us
                    hopes that we should find anchorage near it. We observed with great pleasure,
                    that the land was very high, and covered with cocoa trees; a sure sign that
                    there was water.</p>
                <p>
         <span class="trade">The next
                        morning, I sent Lieutenant Furneaux to the
                        shore, with the boats manned and armed, and all kinds of trinkets, to
                        establish a traffick with the natives, for such refreshment as the place
                        would afford. I gave him orders also to find, if possible, an anchoring
                        place for the ship. While we were getting out the boats, several canoes put
                        off from the island, but as soon as the people on board saw them make
                        towards the shore, they put back. At noon, the boats returned, and brought
                        with them a pig and a cock, with a few plantains and cocoa nuts.
                            Mr. Furneaux reported, that he had seen at least an
                        hundred of the inhabitants, and believed there were many more upon the
                        island; but that having been all round it, he could find no anchorage, nor
                        scarcely a landing-place for the boat. When he reached the shore, he came to
                        a grapling, and threw a warp to the Indians upon the beach, who caught it
                        and held it fast. He then began to converse with them by signs, and observed
                        that they had no weapon among them, but that some of them had white sticks,
                        which seemed to be ensigns of authority, as the people who bore them kept
                        the rest of the natives back. In return for the pig and the cock, he gave
                        them some beads, a looking-glass, a few combs, with several other trinkets,
                        and a hatchet. The women, who had been kept at a distance, as soon as they
                        saw the trinkets, ran down in a croud to the beach, with great eagerness,
                        but were soon driven away by <em>--page 432--
        </em>the men, at which they expressed
                        much disappointment and vexation.</span>
                    <span class="natives">While this traffick was carrying
                        on, a man came secretly round a rock, and diving down, took up the boat's
                        grappling, and at the same time, the people on shore who held the warp, made
                        an effort to draw her into the surf.</span> As soon as this was perceived by
                    the people on board, they fixed a musket over the man's head who had taken up
                    the grappling, upon which he instantly let it go, with marks of great terror and
                    astonishment; the people on shore also let go the rope. The boats after this,
                    lay some time upon their oars, but the officer finding that he could get nothing
                    more, returned on board. <span class="natives">Mr.
                            Furneaux told me that both the men and women were cloathed,
                        and he brought a piece of their cloth away with him. The inhabitants
                        appeared to him to be more numerous than the island could support, and for
                        this reason, especially as he saw some large double canoes upon the beach,
                        he imagined there were islands of larger extent, not far distant, where
                        refreshments in greater plenty might be procured, and hoped that they might
                        be less difficult of access.</span> As I thought this a reasonable conjecture,
                    I hoisted in the boats, and determined to run farther to the westward. To this
                    place, which is nearly circular, and about two miles over, I gave the name of
                        OSNABURGH ISLAND, in honour of Prince
                        Frederick, who is bishop of that see. It lies in latitude 17°
                        <span class="geo">51′ S</span>. and longitude <span class="geo">147° 30′
                        W</span>.; the variation here was 7° 10′ E.</p>

                <em>--page 433--
        </em>
                <p>AT two o'clock, the same
                        day, we bore away, and in about half an hour, <span class="landsighting">discovered very high land</span> in the W. S. W. At
                        seven in the evening, Osnaburgh
                        Island bore E. N. E. and the new discovered land, from W. N. W.
                    to W. by S. <span class="weather">As the weather was thick and
                        squally, we brought to for the night, or at least till the fog should break
                        away.</span> At two in the morning, it being very
                    clear, we made sail again; at day-break
                    <span class="landsighting">we saw the land</span>, at about five
                    leagues distance, and steered directly for it; but at eight o'clock, when we were close under it, <span class="contact">the fog obliged us again to lie to, and when it cleared
                        away, we were much surprised to find ourselves surrounded by some hundreds
                        of canoes. They were of different sizes, and had on board different numbers,
                        from one to ten, so that in all of them together, there could not be less
                        than eight hundred people. When they came within pistol shot of the ship,
                        they lay by, gazing at us with great astonishment, and by turns conferring
                        with each other. In the mean time we shewed them trinkets of various kinds,
                        and invited them on board. Soon after, they drew together, and held a kind
                        of council, to determine what should be done: then they all paddled round
                        the ship, making signs of friendship, and one of them holding up a branch of
                        the plantain tree, made a speech that lasted near a quarter of an <em>--page 434--
        </em>hour, and then threw it into the sea. Soon after, as we
                        continued to make signs of invitation, a fine, stout, lively young man
                        ventured on board: he came up by the mizen chains, and jumped out of the
                        shrouds upon the top of the awning. We made signs to him to come down upon
                        the quarter-deck, and handed up some trinkets to him: he looked pleased, but
                        would accept of nothing till some of the Indians came along side, and after
                        much talk, threw a few branches of plantain tree on board the ship. He then
                        accepted our presents, and several others very soon came on board, at
                        different parts of the ship, not knowing the proper entrance. As one of
                        these Indians was standing near the gang-way, on the larboard side of the
                        quarter-deck, one of our goats butted him upon the haunches: being surprised
                        at the blow, he turned hastily about, and saw the goat raised upon his
                        hind-legs, ready to repeat the blow. The appearance of this animal, so
                        different from any he had ever seen, struck him with such terror, that he
                        instantly leaped over board; and all the rest, upon seeing what had
                        happened, followed his example with the utmost precipitation: they recovered
                        however, in a short time, from their fright, and returned on board. After
                        having a little reconciled them to our goats and sheep, I shewed them our
                        hogs and poultry, and they immediately made signs that they had such animals
                        as these. I then distributed trinkets and nails among them, and made signs
                        that they should go on shore and bring us some of their hogs, fowls and
                        fruit, but they did not seem to understand my meaning: they were, in the
                        mean time, watching an opportunity to steal some of the things that happened
                        to lie in their way, but we generally detected them in the attempt.</span>
                    <span class="theft">At last, however, one of the midshipmen happened
                        to come where they were standing, with a new laced hat upon his head, and
                        began to talk to <em>--page 435--
        </em>one of them by signs: while he was thus
                        engaged, another of them came behind him, and suddenly snatching off the
                        hat, leaped over the taffarel into the sea, and swam away with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p>As we had no anchorage here, we stood along the shore, sending the boats at the
                    same time to sound at a less distance. As none of these canoes had sails, they
                    could not keep up with us, and therefore soon paddled back towards the shore.
                    The country has the most delightful and romantic appearance that can be
                    imagined: towards the sea it is level, and is covered with fruit trees of
                    various kinds, particularly the cocoa nut. Among these are the houses of the
                    inhabitants, consisting only of a roof, and at a distance having greatly the
                    appearance of a long barn. The country within, at about the distance of three
                    miles, rises into lofty hills, that are crowned with wood, and terminate in
                    peaks, from which large rivers are precipitated into the sea. We saw no shoals,
                    but found the island skirted by a reef of rocks, through which there are several
                    openings into deep water. About three o'clock in the afternoon, we brought to,
                    a-breast of a large bay, where there was an appearance of anchorage. The boats
                    were immediately sent to sound it, and while they were thus employed, I observed
                    a great number of canoes gather round them. I suspected that the Indians had a
                    design to attack them, and as I was very desirous to prevent mischief, I made
                    the signal for the boats to come aboard, and at the same time, to intimidate the
                    Indians, I fired a nine pounder over their heads. <span class="violence">As soon as the cutter began to stand towards the ship,
                        the Indians in their canoes, though they had been startled by the thunder of
                        our nine pounder, endeavoured to cut her off. The boat, however, sailing
                        faster than the canoes could paddle, soon got clear of those that were about
                        her; but some others, that <em>--page 436--
        </em>were full of men, way-laid her in
                        her course, and threw several stones into her, which wounded some of the
                        people. Upon this, the officer on board fired a musquet, loaded with
                        buck-shot, at the man who threw the first stone, and wounded him in the
                        shoulder. The rest of the people in the canoes, as soon as they perceived
                        their companion wounded, leapt into the sea, and the other canoes paddled
                        away, in great terror and confusion.</span> As soon as the boats reached the
                    ship, they were hoisted on board, and just as she was about to stand on, we
                    observed a large canoe, under sail, making after us. As I thought she might have
                    some Chief on board, or might have been dispatched to bring me a message from
                    some Chief, I determined to wait for her. She sailed very fast, and was soon
                    along side of the ship, but we did not observe among those on board, any one
                    that seemed to have an authority over the rest. One of them, however, stood up,
                    and having made a speech, which continued about five minutes, threw on board a
                    branch of the plantain tree. We understood this to be a token of peace, and we
                    returned it, by handing over one of the branches of plantain that had been left
                    on board by our first visitors: with this and some toys, that were afterwards
                    presented to him, he appeared to be much gratified, and after a short time, went
                    away.</p>
                <p>The officers who had been sent out with the boats, informed me that they had
                    sounded close to the reef, and found as great a depth of water as at the other
                    islands: however, as I was now on the weather side of the island, I had reason
                    to expect anchorage in running to leeward. I therefore took this course, but
                    finding breakers that ran off to a great distance from the south-end of the
                    island, I hauled the wind, and continued turning to windward all night, in order
                    to run down on the east side of the island.</p>
                <em>--page 437--
        </em>
                <p>At five o'clock
                    in the morning, we made sail, the land bearing N.
                    W. by W. distant 10 leagues; <span class="landsighting">and there
                        seemed to be land five leagues beyond it, to the N. E.; a remarkable peak,
                        like a sugar loaf, bore N. N. E. when we were about two leagues from the
                        shore, which afforded a most delightful prospect, and was full of houses and
                        inhabitants.</span> We saw several large canoes near the shore, under sail,
                    but they did not steer towards the ship. At noon,
                    we were within two or three miles of the island, and it then bore from S. ¾ W.
                    to N. W. by W. We continued our course along the shore, sometimes at the
                    distance of half a mile, and sometimes at the distance of four or five miles,
                    but hitherto had got no soundings. At six o'clock in the
                        evening, we were a-breast of a fine river, and the coast having a
                    better appearance here than in any other part that we had seen, I determined to
                    stand off and on all night, and try for anchorage in the morning. As soon as it
                    was dark, we saw a great number of lights all along the shore. At day-break, we sent out the boats to sound, and
                    soon after, they made the signal for 20 fathom. This produced an universal joy,
                    which it is not easy to describe, and we immediately ran in, and came to an
                    anchor in 17 fathom, with a clear sandy bottom. We lay about a mile distant from
                    the shore, opposite to a fine run of water; the extreams of the land bearing
                    from E. S. E. to N. W. by W. As soon as we had secured the ship, I sent the
                    boats to sound along the coast, and look at the place where we saw the water.
                        <span class="trade">At this time, a considerable number of
                        canoes came off to the ship, and brought with them hogs, fowls, and fruit in
                        great plenty, which we purchased for trinkets and nails.</span>
                    <span class="violence">But when the boats made towards the shore,
                        the canoes, most of which were double, and very large, sailed after them. At
                        first they kept at a distance, but as the boats approached the <em>--page 438--
        </em>shore, they grew bolder, and at last three of the largest ran at the
                        cutter, staved in her quarter, and carried away her out-rigger, the Indians
                        preparing at the same time to board her, with their clubs and paddles in
                        their hands. Our people being thus pressed, were obliged to fire, by which
                        one of the assailants was killed, and another much wounded. Upon receiving
                        the shot, they both fell overboard, and all the people who were in the same
                        canoe, instantly leaped into the sea after them: the other two canoes
                        dropped a-stern, and our boats went on without any farther interruption. As
                        soon as the Indians, who were in the water, saw that the boats stood on
                        without attempting to do them any farther hurt, they recovered their canoe,
                        and hauled in their wounded companions. They set them both upon their feet
                        to see if they could stand, and finding they could not, they tried whether
                        they could sit upright: one of them could, and him they supported in that
                        posture, but perceiving that the other was quite dead, they laid the body
                        along at the bottom of the canoe.</span> After this some of the canoes went
                    ashore, and others returned again to the ship to traffick, which is a proof that
                    our conduct had convinced them that while they behaved peaceably they had
                    nothing to fear, and that they were conscious they had brought the mischief
                    which had just happened upon themselves.</p>
                <p>The boats continued sounding till noon, when they
                    returned with an account that the ground was very clear; that it was at the
                    depth of five fathom, within a quarter of a mile of the shore, but that there
                    was a very great surf where we had seen the water. The officers told me, that
                    the inhabitants swarmed upon the beach, and that many of them swam off to the
                    boat with fruit, and bamboos filled with water. They said that they were very
                    importunate with them to come on shore, particularly the women, who came down to
                    the <em>--page 439--
        </em>beach, and stripping themselves naked, endeavoured to allure
                    them by many wanton gestures, the meaning of which could not possibly be
                    mistaken. At this time, however, our people resisted the temptation.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon, I sent the boats again to the shore, with some barecas, or
                    small casks, which are filled at the head, and have a handle by which they are
                    carried, to endeavour to procure some water, of which we began to be in great
                    want. In the mean time, many of the canoes continued about the ship, but the
                    Indians had been guilty of so many thefts, that I would not suffer any more of
                    them to come on board.</p>
                <p>
         <span class="violence">At five in the evening, the boats returned
                        with only two barecas of water, which the natives had filled for them; and
                        as a compensation for their trouble, they thought fit to detain all the
                        rest. Our people, who did not leave their boat, tried every expedient they
                        could think of to induce the Indians to return their water vessels, but
                        without success; and the Indians, in their turn, were very pressing for our
                        people to come on shore, which they thought it prudent to decline.</span>
                    There were many thousands of the inhabitants of both sexes, and a great number
                    of children on the beach, when our boats came away.</p>
                <p>The next morning, <span class="trade">I sent the boats on shore again for water, with nails,
                        hatchets, and such other things as I thought most likely to gain the
                        friendship of the inhabitants. In the mean time, a great number of canoes
                        came off to the ship, with bread-fruit*, plantains, a fruit resembling an
                        apple only better, fowls, and hogs, which we purchased with beads, nails,
                        knives, and other articles of the like kind, so <em>--page 440--
        </em>that we
                        procured pork enough to serve the ship's company two days, at a pound a
                        man.</span>
                </p>
                <p>When the boats returned, they brought us only a few calibashes of water, for the
                    number of people on the beach was so great, that they would not venture to land,
                    though the young women repeated the allurements which they had practised the day
                    before, with still more wanton, and, if possible, less equivocal gestures. Fruit
                    and provisions of various kinds were brought down and ranged upon the beach, of
                    which our people were also invited to partake, as an additional inducement for
                    them to leave the boat. They continued, however, inexorable, and shewing the
                    Indians the barecas on board, made signs that they should bring down those which
                    had been detained the day before: to this the Indians were inexorable in their
                    turn, and our people therefore weighed their grapplings, and sounded all round
                    the place, to see whether the ship could come in near enough to cover the
                    waterers, in which case they might venture on shore, in defiance of the whole
                    island. When they put off, the women pelted them with apples and bananas,
                    shouting, and shewing every mark of derision and contempt that they could
                    devise. They reported, that the ship might ride in four fathom water, with sandy
                    ground, at two cables' length from the shore, and in five fathom water at three
                    cables' length. The wind here blew right along the shore, raising a great surf
                    on the side of the vessel, and on the beach.</p>
                <p>At day-break, the next morning, we weighed, with a
                    design to anchor off the watering-place. As we were standing off, to get farther
                    to windward, we discovered a bay about six or eight miles to leeward, over the
                    land, from the <em>--page 441--
        </em>mast-head, and immediately bore away for it, sending
                    the boats a-head to sound. At nine o'clock, the
                    boats making the signal for 12 fathom, we hauled round a reef, and stood in,
                    with a design to come to an anchor; but when we came near the boats, one of
                    which was on each bow, the ship struck. Her head continued immoveable, but her
                    stern was free; and, upon casting the lead, we found the depth of water, upon
                    the reef or shoal, to be from 17 fathom to two and a half: we clewed all up as
                    fast as possible, and cleared the ship of what lumber there happened to be upon
                    the deck, at the same time getting out the long-boat, with the stream and kedge
                    anchors, the stream cable and hauser, in order to carry them without the reef,
                    that when they had taken ground, the ship might be drawn off towards them, by
                    applying a great force to the capstern, but unhappily without the reef we had no
                    bottom. Our condition was now very alarming, the ship continued beating against
                    the rock with great force, and we were surrounded by many hundred canoes, full
                    of men: they did not, however, attempt to come on board us, but seemed to wait
                    in expectation of our shipwreck. In the anxiety and terror of such a situation
                    we continued near an hour, without being able to do any thing for our
                    deliverance, except staving some water casks in the fore-hold, when a breeze
                    happily springing up from the shore, the ship's head swung off. We immediately
                    pressed her with all the sail we could make; upon which she began to move, and
                    was very soon once more in deep water.</p>
                <p>We now stood off, and the boats being sent to leeward, found that the reef ran
                    down to the westward about a mile and a half, and that beyond it there was a
                    very good harbour. The master, after having placed a boat at the end of the
                    reef, and furnished the long-boat with anchor and hausers, <em>--page 442--
        </em>and a
                    guard to defend her from an attack of the Indians, came on board, and piloted
                    the ship round the reef into the harbour, where, about twelve o'clock, she came to an anchor in 17 fathom water, with a
                    fine bottom of black sand. </p>
                <p>The place where the ship struck appeared, upon farther examination, to be a reef
                    of sharp coral rock, with very unequal soundings, from six fathom to two; and it
                    happened unfortunately to lie between the two boats that were placed as a
                    direction to the ship, the weathermost boat having 12 fathom, and the
                    leewardmost nine. The wind freshened almost as soon as we got off, and though it
                    soon became calm again, the surf ran so high, and broke with such violence upon
                    the rock, that if the ship had continued fast half an hour longer, she must
                    inevitably have been beaten to pieces. Upon examining her bottom, we could not
                    discover that she had received any damage, except that a small piece was beaten
                    off the bottom of the rudder. She did not appear to admit any water, but the
                    trussle-trees, at the head of all the masts, were broken short, which we
                    supposed to have happened while she was beating against the rock. Our boats lost
                    their grapplings upon the reef, but as we had reason to hope that the ship was
                    sound, they gave us very little concern. As soon as the ship was secured, I sent
                    the master, with all the boats manned and armed, to sound the upper part of the
                    bay, that if he found good anchorage we might warp the ship up within the reef,
                    and anchor her in safety. The weather was now very pleasant, a great number of
                    canoes were upon the reef, and the shore was crouded with people.</p>
                <p>About four in the afternoon the master returned, and
                    reported, that there was every where good anchorage; I therefore determined to
                    warp the ship up the bay early in <em>--page 443--
        </em>the morning, and in the mean
                    time, I put the people at four watches, one watch to be always under arms;
                    loaded and primed all the guns, fixed musquetoons in all the boats, and ordered
                    all the people who were not upon the watch, to repair to the quarters assigned
                    them, at a moment's warning there being a great number of canoes, some of them
                    very large, and full of men, hovering upon the shore, <span class="trade">and many smaller venturing to the ship, with hogs, fowls,
                        and fruit, which we purchased of them, much to the satisfaction of both
                        parties;</span> and at sun-set, all the canoes rowed in to the shore. </p>
                <p>At six o'clock
                    the next morning, we began to warp the ship up
                    the harbour, and soon after, a great number of canoes came under her stern.<span class="trade"> As I perceived that they had hogs, fowls, and
                        fruit on board, I ordered the gunner, and two midshipmen, to purchase them
                        for knives, nails, beads, and other trinkets, at the same time prohibiting
                        the trade to all other persons on board.</span> By eight
                        o'clock, the number of canoes was greatly increased, and those that
                    came last up were double, of a very large size, with twelve or fifteen stout men
                    in each. <span class="violence">I observed, with some concern,
                        that they appeared to be furnished rather for war than trade, having very
                        little on board except round pebble stones; I therefore sent for
                            Mr. Furneaux, my first lieutenant being still very
                        ill, and ordered him to keep the fourth watch constantly at their arms,
                        while the rest of the people were warping the ship. In the mean time more
                        canoes were continually coming off from the shore, which were freighted very
                        differently from the rest, for they had on board a number of women who were
                        placed in a row, and who, when they came near the ship, made all the wanton
                        gestures that can be conceived. While these ladies were practising their
                        allurements, the large canoes, which were freighted with <em>--page 444--
        </em>stones, drew together very close round the ship, some of the men on board
                        singing in a hoarse voice, some blowing conchs, and some playing on a flute.
                        After some time, a man who sat upon a canopy that was fixed on one of the
                        large double canoes, made signs that he wished to come up to the ship's
                        side; I immediately intimated my consent, and when he came along side, he
                        gave one of the men a bunch of red and yellow feathers, making signs that he
                        should carry it to me. I received it with expressions of amity, and
                        immediately got some trinkets to present him in return, but to my great
                        surprise he had put off to a little distance from the ship, and upon his
                        throwing up the branch of a cocoa-nut tree, there was an universal shout
                        from all the canoes, which at once moved towards the ship, and a shower of
                        stones was poured into her on every side. As an attack was now begun, in
                        which our arms only could render us superior to the multitude that assailed
                        us, especially as great part of the ship's company was in a sick and feeble
                        condition, I ordered the guard to fire; two of the quarter-deck guns, which
                        I had loaded with small shot, were also fired nearly at the same time, and
                        the Indians appeared to be thrown into some confusion: in a few minutes,
                        however, they renewed the attack, and all our people that were able to come
                        upon deck, having by this time got to their quarters, I ordered them to fire
                        the great guns, and to play some of them constantly at a place on shore,
                        where a great number of canoes were still taking in men, and pushing off
                        towards the ship with the utmost expedition. When the great guns began to
                        fire, there were not less than three hundred canoes about the ship, having
                        on board at least two thousand men; many thousands were also upon the shore,
                        and more canoes coming from every quarter: the firing, however, soon drove
                        away the canoes that were about the ship, and put a stop to the <em>--page 445--
        </em>coming off of others. As soon as I saw some of them retreating, and the
                        rest quiet, I ordered the firing to cease, hoping that they were
                        sufficiently convinced of our superiority, not to renew the contest. In
                        this, however, I was unhappily mistaken: a great number of the canoes that
                        had been dispersed, soon drew together again, and lay some time on their
                        paddles, looking at the ship from the distance of about a quarter of a mile,
                        and then suddenly hoisting white streamers, pulled towards the ship's stern,
                        and began again to throw stones, with great force and dexterity, by the help
                        of slings, from a considerable distance: each of these stones weighed about
                        two pounds, and many of them wounded the people on board, who would have
                        suffered much more, if an awning had not been spread over the whole deck to
                        keep out the sun, and the hammocks placed in the nettings. At the same time
                        several canoes, well manned, were making towards the ship's bow, having
                        probably taken notice that no shot had been fired from this part: I
                        therefore ordered some guns forward, to be well pointed and fired at these
                        canoes; at the same time running out two guns abaft, and pointing them well
                        at the canoes that were making the attack. Among the canoes that were coming
                        toward the bow, there was one which appeared to have some Chief on board, as
                        it was by signals made from her, that the others had been called together:
                        it happened that a shot, fired from the guns forward, hit this canoe so full
                        as to cut it asunder. As soon as this was observed by the rest, they
                        dispersed with such haste that in half an hour there was not a single canoe
                        to be seen; the people also who had crouded the shore, immediately fled over
                        the hills with the utmost precipitation.</span>
      </p>
                <p>Having now no reason to fear any further interruption, we warped the ship up the
                    harbour, and by noon, we were <em>--page 446--
        </em>not more
                    than half a mile from the upper part of the bay, within less than two cables'
                    length of a fine river, and about two and a half of the reef. We had here nine
                    fathom water, and close to the shore there were five. We moored the ship, and
                    carried out the stream-anchor, with the two shroud hausers, for a spring, to
                    keep the ship's broad-side a-breast of the river; we also got up and mounted the
                    eight guns which had been put into the hold. As soon as this was done, the boats
                    were employed in sounding all round the bay, and in examining the shore where
                    any of the inhabitants appeared, in order to discover, whether it was probable
                    that they would give us any further disturbance. All the afternoon, and part of the next morning, was spent in this
                    service; and about noon, the master returned, with
                    a tolerable survey of the place, and reported, that there were no canoes in
                    sight; that there was good landing on every part of the beach; that there was
                    nothing in the bay from which danger could be apprehended, except the reef, and
                    some rocks at the upper end, which appeared above water; and that the river,
                    though it emptied itself on the other side of the point, was fresh water.</p>
                <p>Soon after the master had brought me this account, I sent Mr.
                        Furneaux again, with all the boats manned and armed, the marines
                    being also put on board, with orders to land opposite to our station, and secure
                    himself, under cover of the boats and the ship, in the clearest ground he could
                    find. About two o'clock the boats landed without
                    any opposition, and Mr. Furneaux stuck up a staff, upon
                    which he hoisted a pendant, turned a turf, and took possession of the island in
                    his Majesty's name, in honour of whom he called it KING GEORGE THE
                        THIRD's ISLAND: he then went to the river, and tasted the water,
                    which he found excellent, and mixing some of it with rum, every man drank his
                    Majesty's health. <em>--page 447--
        </em>
         <span class="contact">While he was
                        at the river, which was about twelve yards wide, and fordable, he saw two
                        old men on the opposite side of it, who perceiving that they were
                        discovered, put themselves in a supplicatory posture, and seemed to be in
                        great terror and confusion. Mr. Furneaux made signs
                        that they should come over the river, and one of them complied. When he
                        landed, he came forward, creeping upon his hands and knees, but
                            Mr. Furneaux raised him up, and while he stood
                        trembling, shewed him some of the stones that were thrown at the ship, and
                        endeavoured to make him apprehend that if the natives attempted no mischief
                        against us, we should do no harm to them. He ordered two of the water casks
                        to be filled, to shew the Indian that we wanted water, and produced some
                        hatchets, and other things, to intimate that he wished to trade for
                        provisions. The old man, during this pantomimical conversation, in some
                        degree recovered his spirits; and Mr. Furneaux, to
                        confirm his professions of friendship, gave him a hatchet, some nails,
                        beads, and other trifles; after which he reimbarked on board the boats, and
                        left the pendant flying. As soon as the boats were put off, the old man went
                        up to the pendant, and danced round it a considerable time: he then retired,
                        but soon after returned with some green boughs, which he threw down, and
                        retired a second time: it was not long, however, before he appeared again,
                        with about a dozen of the inhabitants, and putting themselves in a
                        supplicating posture, they all approached the pendant in a slow pace, but
                        the wind happening to move it, when they were got close to it, they suddenly
                        retreated with the greatest precipitation. After standing some time at a
                        distance, and gazing at it, they went away, but in a short time came back,
                        with two large hogs alive, which they laid down at the foot of the staff,
                        and at length taking courage, they began to dance. When they had performed
                            <em>--page 448--
        </em>this ceremony, they brought the hogs down to the water
                        side, launched a canoe, and put them on board. The old man, who had a large
                        white beard, then embarked with them alone, and brought them to the ship:
                        when he came along side, he made a set speech, and afterwards handed in
                        several green plantain leaves, one by one, uttering a sentence, in a solemn
                        slow tone, with each of them as he delivered it; after this he sent on board
                        the two hogs, and then turning round, pointed to the land. I ordered some
                        presents to be given him, but he would accept of nothing; and soon after put
                        off his canoe, and went on shore.</span>
      </p>
                <p>At night, soon after it was dark, we heard the noise of many drums, with conchs,
                    and other wind instruments, and saw a multitude of lights all along the coast.
                        At six
                    in the morning, seeing none of the natives on
                    shore, and observing that the pendant was taken away, which probably they had
                    learnt to despise, as the frogs in the fable did King Log, I ordered the
                    lieutenant to take a guard on shore, and if all was well, to send off, that we
                    might begin watering: in a short time I had the satisfaction to find that he had
                    sent off for water casks, and by eight o'clock, we
                    had four tons of water on board. <span class="contact">While our
                        people were employed in filling the casks, several of the natives appeared
                        on the opposite side of the river, with the old man whom the officer had
                        seen the day before; and soon after he came over, and brought with him a
                        little fruit, and a few fowls, which were also sent off to the ship.</span>
                    <span class="health">At this time, having been very ill for near a
                        fortnight, I was so weak that I could scarcely crawl about; however, I
                        employed my glasses to see what was doing on shore.</span>
                    <span class="violence">At near half an hour
                            after eight o'clock, I perceived a multitude of the natives
                        coming over a hill at about the distance of a mile, and at the same time a
                        great number of canoes making round the western point, and <em>--page 449--
        </em>keeping close along the shore. I then looked at the watering-place, and
                        saw at the back of it, where it was clear, a very numerous party of the
                        natives creeping along behind the bushes; I saw also many thousands in the
                        woods, pushing along towards the watering-place, and canoes coming very fast
                        round the other point of the bay to the eastward. Being alarmed at these
                        appearances, I dispatched a boat, to acquaint the officer on shore with what
                        I had seen, and order him immediately to come on board with his men, and
                        leave the casks behind him: he had, however, discovered his danger, and
                        embarked before the boat reached him. Having perceived the Indians that were
                        creeping towards him under shelter of the wood, he immediately dispatched
                        the old man to them, making signs that they should keep at a distance, and
                        that he wanted nothing but water. As soon as they perceived that they were
                        discovered, they began to shout, and advanced with greater speed. The
                        officer immediately repaired to the boats with his people, and the Indians,
                        in the mean time having crossed the river, took possession of the water
                        casks, with great appearance of exultation and joy. The canoes now pulled
                        along the shore, towards the place, with the utmost expedition, all the
                        people on land keeping pace with them, except a multitude of women and
                        children, who seated themselves upon a hill which overlooked the bay and the
                        beach. The canoes from each point of the bay, as they drew nearer to that
                        part of it where the ship was at anchor, put on shore, and took in more men,
                        who had great bags in their hands, which afterwards appeared to be filled
                        with stones. All the canoes that had come round the points, and many others
                        that had put off from the shore within the bay, now made towards the ship,
                        so that I had no doubt but that they intended to try <em>--page 450--
        </em>their
                        fortune in a second attack. As to shorten the contest would certainly lessen
                        the mischief, I determined to make this action decisive, and put an end to
                        hostilities at once; I therefore ordered the people, who were all at their
                        quarters, to fire first upon the canoes which were drawn together in groups:
                        this was immediately done so effectually, that those which were to the
                        westward made towards the shore as fast as possible, and those to the
                        eastward, getting round the reef, were soon beyond the reach of our guns. I
                        then directed the fire into the wood in different parts, which soon drove
                        the Indians out of it, who ran up the hill where the women and children had
                        seated themselves to see the battle. Upon this hill there were now several
                        thousands who thought themselves in perfect security; but to convince them
                        of the contrary, and hoping that when they saw the shot fall much farther
                        than they could think possible, they would suppose it could reach them at
                        any distance, I ordered some of the guns to be let down as low as they would
                        admit, and fired four shot towards them. Two of the balls fell close by a
                        tree where a great number of these people were fitting, and struck them with
                        such terror and consternation, that in less than two minutes not one of them
                        was to be seen. Having thus cleared the coast, I manned and armed the boats,
                        and putting a strong guard on board, I sent all the carpenters with their
                        axes, and ordered them to destroy every canoe that had been run ashore.
                        Before noon, this service was effectually performed, and more than fifty
                        canoes, many of which were sixty feet long, and three broad, and lashed
                        together, were cut to pieces. Nothing was found in them but stones and
                        slings, except a little fruit, and a few fowls and hogs, which were on board
                        two or three canoes of a much smaller size.</span>
      </p>
                <em>--page 451--
        </em>
                <p>At two o'clock in the afternoon, <span class="trade">about ten of the natives came out of the wood with green
                        boughs in their hands, which they stuck up near the water side, and retired.
                        After a short time, they appeared again, and brought with them several hogs,
                        with their legs tied, which they placed near the green boughs, and retired a
                        second time. After this they brought down several more hogs, and some dogs,
                        with their fore legs tied over their heads, and going again into the woods,
                        brought back several bundles of the cloth which they use for apparel, and
                        which has some resemblance to Indian paper. These they placed upon the
                        beach, and called to us on board to fetch them away. As we were at the
                        distance of about three cables' length, we could not then perfectly discover
                        of what this peace-offering consisted: we guessed at the hogs and the cloth,
                        but seeing the dogs, with their fore legs appearing over the hinder part of
                        the neck, rise up several times, and run a little way in an erect posture,
                        we took them for some strange unknown animal, and were very impatient to
                        have a nearer view of them. The boat was therefore sent on shore with all
                        expedition, and our wonder was soon at an end. Our people found nine good
                        hogs, besides the dogs and the cloth: the hogs were brought off, but the
                        dogs were turned loose, and with the cloth left behind. In return for the
                        hogs, our people left upon the shore some hatchets, nails, and other things,
                        making signs to some of the Indians who were in sight, to take them away
                        with their cloth. Soon after the boat had come on board, the Indians brought
                        down two more hogs, and called to us to fetch them; the boat therefore
                        returned, and fetched off the two hogs, but still left the cloth, though the
                        Indians made signs that we should take it. Our people reported, that they
                        had not touched any of the things which <em>--page 452--
        </em>they had left upon the
                        beach for them, and somebody suggesting that they would not take our
                        offering because we had not accepted their cloth, I gave orders that it
                        should be fetched away. The event proved that the conjecture was true, for
                        the moment the boat had taken the cloth on board, the Indians came down, and
                        with every possible demonstration of joy, carried away all I had sent them
                        into the wood.</span> Our boats then went to the watering-place, and filled
                    and brought off all the casks, to the amount of about six tons. We found that
                    they had suffered no injury while they had been in the possession of the
                    Indians, but some leathern buckets and funnels which had been taken away with
                    the casks, were not returned.</p>
                <p>
                    The next morning
                    <span class="contact">I sent the boats on shore, with a guard, to
                        fill some more casks with water, and soon after the people were on shore,
                        the same old man who had come over the river to them the first day, came
                        again to the farther side of it, where he made a long speech, and then
                        crossed the water. When he came up to the waterers, the officer shewed him
                        the stones that were piled up like cannon balls upon the shore, and had been
                        brought thither since our first landing, and some of the bags that had been
                        taken out of the canoes which I had ordered to be destroyed, filled with
                        stones, and endeavoured to make him understand that the Indians had been the
                        aggressors, and that the mischief we had done them was in our own defence.
                        The old man seemed to apprehend his meaning, but not to admit it: he
                        immediately made a speech to the people, pointing to the stones, slings, and
                        bags, with great emotion, and sometimes his looks, gestures, and voice were
                        so furious as to be frightful. His passions, however, subsided by degrees,
                        and the officer, who to his great regret could not understand one <em>--page 453--
        </em>word of all that he had said, endeavoured to convince him, by
                        all the signs he could devise, that we wished to live in friendship with
                        them, and were disposed to shew them every mark of kindness in our power. He
                        then shook hands with him, and embraced him, giving him at the same time
                        several such trinkets as he thought would be most acceptable. He contrived
                        also to make the old man understand that we wished to traffick for
                        provisions, that the Indians should not come down in great numbers, and that
                        they should keep on one side of the river and we on the other.</span>
                    <span class="provisions">After this the old man went away with
                        great appearance of satisfaction, and before noon a trade was established,
                        which furnished us with hogs, fowls, and fruit in great abundance, so that
                        all the ship's company, whether sick or well, had as much as they could
                        use.</span>

                    Natives; some Account of their Character and Manners, of their Visits on board

                <em>--page 454--
        </em>
                <p>MATTERS being thus happily settled, I sent the Surgeon, with the Second
                    Lieutenant, to examine the country, and fix upon some place where the sick might
                    take up their residence on shore. When they returned, they said, that with
                    respect to health and convenience, all the places that they had seen upon the
                    island seemed to be equally proper; but that with respect to safety, they could
                    recommend none but the watering-place, as they would be there under the
                    protection of the ship and the guard, and would easily be prevented from
                    straggling into the country, and brought off to their meals. To the
                    watering-place therefore I sent them, with those that were employed in filling
                    the casks, and appointed the gunner to command the party that was to be their
                    guard. A tent was erected for them as a shelter both from the sun and the rain,
                    and the Surgeon was sent to superintend their conduct, and give his advice if it
                    should be wanted. <span class="contact">It happened that walking
                        out with his gun, after he had seen the sick properly disposed of in the
                        tent, a wild duck flew over his head, which he shot, and it fell dead among
                        some of the natives who were on the other side of the river. This threw them
                        into a panic, and <em>--page 455--
        </em>they all ran away: when they got to some
                        distance they stopped, and he made signs to them to bring the duck over:
                        this one of them at last ventured to do, and, pale and trembling, laid it
                        down at his feet. Several other ducks happening at the instant to fly over
                        the spot where they were standing, he fired again, and fortunately brought
                        down three more. This incident gave the natives such a dread of a gun, that
                        if a musquet was pointed at a thousand of them, they would all run away like
                        a flock of sheep; and probably the ease with which they were afterwards kept
                        at a distance, and their orderly behaviour in their traffick, was in a great
                        measure owing to their having upon this occasion seen the instrument of
                        which before they had only felt the effects.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="trade">As I foresaw that a private traffick would
                        probably commence between such of our people as were on shore, and the
                        natives, and that if it was left to their own caprice, perpetual quarrels
                        and mischief would ensue, I ordered that all matters of traffick should be
                        transacted by the gunner, on behalf of both parties, and I directed him to
                        see that no injury was done to the natives, either by violence or fraud, and
                        by all possible means to attach the old man to his interest.</span>
         <span class="theft"> This service he performed with great
                        diligence and fidelity, nor did he neglect to complain of those who
                        transgressed my orders, which was of infinite advantage to all parties; for
                        as I punished the first offenders with a necessary severity, many
                        irregularities, that would otherwise have produced the most disagreeable
                        consequences, were prevented: we were also indebted for many advantages to
                        the old man, whose caution kept our people perpetually upon their guard, and
                        soon brought back those who straggled from the party. The natives would
                        indeed sometimes pilfer, but by the terror of a gun, without using it, he
                        always found means to make them bring back what was stolen. A fellow had one
                        day the <em>--page 456--
        </em>dexterity and address to cross the river unperceived,
                        and steal a hatchet; the gunner, as soon as he missed it, made the old man
                        understand what had happened, and got his party ready, as if he would have
                        gone into the woods after the thief: the old man, however, made signs that
                        he would save him the trouble, and immediately setting off, returned in a
                        very short time with the hatchet. The gunner then insisted that the offender
                        should be delivered up, and with this also the old man, though not without
                        great reluctance, complied. When the fellow was brought down, the gunner
                        knew him to be an old offender, and therefore sent him prisoner on board. I
                        had no intention to punish him otherwise, than by the fear of punishment,
                        and therefore, after great entreaty and intercession, I gave him his
                        liberty, and sent him on shore.</span>
                    <span class="contact">When the natives saw him return in safety,
                        it is hard to say whether their astonishment or joy was greatest; they
                        received him with universal acclamations, and immediately carried him off
                        into the woods: the next day, however, he returned, and as a propitiation to
                        the gunner, he brought him a considerable quantity of bread-fruit, and a
                        large hog, ready roasted.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="repair">At this time, the people on board were
                        employed in caulking and painting the weather-work, over-hauling the
                        rigging, stowing the hold, and doing other necessary business,</span>
                    <span class="health">but my disorder, which was a bilious cholic,
                        increased so much, that this day I was obliged to take to my bed; my First
                        Lieutenant also still continued very ill, and the Purser was incapable of
                        his duty.</span> The whole command devolved upon Mr.
                        Furneaux, the Second Lieutenant, to whom I gave general
                    directions, and recommended a particular attention to the people on shore. I
                    also ordered that fruit and fresh provisions should be served to the ship's
                    company as long as they could be procured, and that the boats should never be
                        <em>--page 457--
        </em>absent from the ship after sun-set. These directions were
                    fulfilled with such prudence and punctuality, that during all my sickness I was
                    not troubled with any business, nor had the mortification to hear a single
                    complaint or appeal. <span class="health">The men were constantly
                        served with fresh pork, fowls, and fruit, in such plenty, that when I left
                        my bed, after having been confined to it near a fortnight, my ship's company
                        looked so fresh and healthy, that I could scarcely believe them to be the
                        same people.</span>
      </p>
                <p>Sunday the 28th was marked by no incident; but on
                        Monday the 29th, <span class="contact">one of the gunner's party found a piece of saltpetre near
                        as big as an egg. As this was an object of equal curiosity and importance,
                        diligent enquiry was immediately made from whence it came. The surgeon asked
                        every one of the people on shore, separately, whether he had brought it from
                        the ship; every one on board also was asked whether he had carried it on
                        shore, but all declared that they had never had such a thing in their
                        possession. Application was then made to the natives, but the meaning of
                        both parties was so imperfectly conveyed by signs, that nothing could be
                        learnt of them about it: during our whole stay here, however, we saw no more
                        than this one piece.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="food">While the gunner was trafficking for provisions
                        on shore, we sometimes hauled the seine, but we caught no fish; we also
                        frequently crawled, but with no better success: the disappointment, however,
                        was not felt, for the produce of the island enabled our people to "fare
                        sumptuously every day."</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="food">All matters continued in the same situation till
                        the 2d of July, when our old man being
                        absent, the supply of fresh provisions and fruit fell short; we had,
                        however, enough to <em>--page 458--
        </em>serve most of the messes, reserving plenty
                        for the sick and convalescent.</span>
      </p>
                <p>On the 3d, we heeled the ship, and looked at her
                    bottom, which we found as clean as when she came out of dock, and to our great
                    satisfaction, as sound. <span class="contact">During all this
                        time, none of the natives came near our boats, or the ship, in their canoes.
                        This day, about noon, we caught a very large shark, and when the boats went
                        to fetch the people on board to dinner, we sent it on shore. When the boats
                        were putting off again, the gunner seeing some of the natives on the other
                        side of the river, beckoned them to come over; they immediately complied,
                        and he gave them the shark, which they soon cut to pieces, and carried away
                        with great appearance of satisfaction.</span>
      </p>
                <p>On Sunday the 5th, the old man returned to the
                    market-tent, and made the gunner understand that he had been up the country, to
                    prevail upon the people to bring down their hogs, poultry, and fruit, of which
                    the parts near the watering-place were now nearly exhausted. <span class="trade">The good effects of his expedition soon appeared, for
                        several Indians, whom our people had never seen before, came in with some
                        hogs that were larger than any that had been yet brought to market. In the
                        mean time, the old man ventured off in his canoe, to the ship, and brought
                        with him, as a present to me, a hog ready roasted. I was much pleased with
                        his attention and liberality, and gave him, in return for his hog, an iron
                        pot, a looking-glass, a drinking-glass, and several other things, which no
                        man in the island was in possession of but himself.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="trade">While our people were on shore, several young
                        women were permitted to cross the river, who, though they were not averse to
                        the granting of personal favours, knew the <em>--page 459--
        </em>value of them too
                        well not to stipulate for a consideration</span>: <span class="theft">the price, indeed, was not great, yet it was such as our men
                        were not always able to pay, and under this temptation they stole nails and
                        other iron from the ship. The nails that we brought for traffick, were not
                        always in their reach, and therefore they drew several out of different
                        parts of the vessel, particularly those that fastened the cleats to the
                        ship's side. This was productive of a double mischief; damage to the ship,
                        and a considerable rise at market. When the gunner offered, as usual, small
                        nails for hogs of a middling size, the natives refused to take them, and
                        produced large spikes, intimating that they expected such nails as these. A
                        most diligent enquiry was set on foot to discover the offenders, but all to
                        no purpose; and though a large reward was offered to procure intelligence,
                        none was obtained. I was mortified at the disappointment, but I was still
                        more mortified at a fraud which I found some of our people had practised
                        upon the natives. When no nails were to be procured, they had stolen lead,
                        and cut it up in the shape of nails. Many of the natives who had been paid
                        with this base money, brought their leaden nails, with great simplicity, to
                        the gunner, and requested him to give them iron in their stead. With this
                        request, however reasonable, he could not comply; because, by rendering lead
                        current, it would have encouraged the stealing it, and the market would have
                        been as effectually spoiled by those who could not procure nails, as by
                        those who could; it was therefore necessary, upon every account, to render
                        this leaden currency of no value, though for our honour I should have been
                        glad to have called it in.</span>
      </p>
                <p>On Tuesday the 7th, <span class="trade">I sent one of the mates, with thirty men, to a village at a
                        little distance from the market, hoping <em>--page 460--
        </em>that refreshments might
                        there be bought at the original price; but here they were obliged to give
                        still more than at the water-side.</span>
                    <span class="natives">In the mean time, being this day able to
                        get up for the first time, and the weather being fine, I went into a boat,
                        and rowed about four miles down the coast. I found the country populous, and
                        pleasant in the highest degree, and saw many canoes on the shore; but not
                        one came off to us, nor did the people seem to take the least notice of us
                        as we passed along. About noon I returned to the ship.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="punishment">The commerce which our men had found means
                        to establish with the women of the island, rendered them much less obedient
                        to the orders that had been given for the regulation of their conduct on
                        shore, than they were at first. I found it necessary therefore, to read the
                        articles of war, and I punished James Proctor, the
                        corporal of marines, who had not only quitted his station, and insulted the
                        officer, but struck the Master at Arms such a blow as brought him to the
                        ground.</span>
      </p>
                <p>The next day, <span class="contact">I sent a party up the country to cut wood, and they met with some of the
                        natives, who treated them with great kindness and hospitality. Several of
                        these friendly Indians came on board in our boat, and seemed, both by their
                        dress and behaviour, to be of a superior rank. To these people I paid a
                        particular attention, and to discover what present would most gratify them,
                        I laid down before them a Johannes, a guinea, a crown piece, a Spanish
                        dollar, a few shillings, some new halfpence, and two large nails, making
                        signs that they should take what they liked best. The nails were first
                        seized, with great eagerness, and then a few of the halfpence, but the
                        silver and gold lay neglected. Having presented them, therefore, with some
                        nails and halfpence, I sent them on shore superlatively happy.</span>
      </p>
                <em>--page 461--
        </em>
                <p>
         <span class="trade">From this time, our market was very ill
                        supplied, the Indians refusing to sell provisions at the usual price, and
                        making signs for large nails.</span>
                    <span class="theft">It was now thought necessary to look more
                        diligently about the ship, to discover what nails had been drawn; and it was
                        soon found that all the belaying cleats had been ripped off, and that there
                        was scarcely one of the hammock nails left. All hands were now ordered up,
                        and I practised every artifice I could think of to discover the thieves, but
                        without success.</span>
                    <span class="punishment">I then told them that till the thieves were
                        discovered, not a single man should go on shore: this however produced no
                        effect, except that Proctor, the corporal, behaved in a
                        mutinous manner, for which he was instantly punished.</span>
      </p>
                <p>On Saturday the 11th, in the afternoon, <span class="contact">the gunner came on board with a
                        tall woman, who seemed to be about five and forty years of age, of a
                        pleasing countenance and majestic deportment. He told me that she was but
                        just come into that part of the country, and that seeing great respect paid
                        her by the rest of the natives, he had made her some presents; in return for
                        which she had invited him to her house, which was about two miles up the
                        valley, and given him some large hogs; after which she returned with him to
                        the watering-place, and expressed a desire to go on board the ship, in which
                        he had thought it proper, on all accounts, that she should be gratified. She
                        seemed to be under no restraint, either from diffidence or fear, when she
                        first came into the ship; and she behaved, all the while she was on board,
                        with an easy freedom, that always distinguishes conscious superiority and
                        habitual command. I gave her a large blue mantle, that reached from her
                        shoulders to her feet, which I threw over her, and tied on with ribands; I
                        gave her also a looking-glass, beads of several sorts, and many other
                        things, of which she accepted with a very good <em>--page 462--
        </em>grace, and much
                        pleasure. She took notice that I had been ill, and pointed to the shore. I
                        understood that she meant I should go thither to perfect my recovery, and I
                        made signs that I would go thither the next morning. When she intimated an
                        inclination to return, I ordered the gunner to go with her, who, having set
                        her on shore, attended her to her habitation, which he described as being
                        very large and well built. He said, that in this house she had many guards
                        and domesticks, and that she had another at a little distance, which was
                        enclosed in lattice-work.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="contact">The next
                            morning I went on shore for the first time, and my princess, or
                        rather queen, for such by her authority she appeared to be, soon after came
                        to me, followed by many of her attendants. As she perceived that my disorder
                        had left me very weak, she ordered her people to take me in their arms, and
                        carry me not only over the river, but all the way to her house; and
                        observing that some of the people who were with me, particularly the First
                        Lieutenant and Purser, had also been sick, she caused them also to be
                        carried in the same manner, and a guard, which I had ordered out upon the
                        occasion, followed. In our way, a vast multitude crouded about us, but upon
                        her waving her hand, without speaking a word, they withdrew, and left us a
                        free passage. When we approached near her house, a great number of both
                        sexes came out to meet her: these she presented to me, after having
                        intimated by signs that they were her relations, and taking hold of my hand,
                        she made them kiss it. We then entered the house, which covered a piece of
                        ground 327 feet long, and 42 feet broad. It consisted of a roof, thatched
                        with palm leaves, and raised upon 39 pillars on each side, and 14 in the
                        middle. The ridge of the thatch, on the inside, was 30 feet high, and the
                        sides of the house, to the edge of the roof, were 12 feet high; all below
                        the <em>--page 463--
        </em>roof being open. As soon as we entered the house, she made
                        us sit down, and then calling four young girls, she assisted them to take
                        off my shoes, draw down my stockings, and pull off my coat, and then
                        directed them to smooth down the skin, and gently chafe it with their hands:
                        the same operation was also performed upon the First Lieutenant and the
                        Purser, but upon none of those who appeared to be in health. While this was
                        doing, our Surgeon, who had walked till he was very warm, took off his wig
                        to cool and refresh himself: a sudden exclamation of one of the Indians who
                        saw it, drew the attention of the rest, and in a moment every eye was fixed
                        upon the prodigy, and every operation was suspended: the whole assembly
                        stood some time motionless, in silent astonishment, which could not have
                        been more strongly expressed if they had discovered that our friend's limbs
                        had been screwed on to the trunk; in a short time, however, the young women
                        who were chafing us, resumed their employment, and having continued it for
                        about half an hour, they dressed us again, but in this they were, as may
                        easily be imagined, very aukward; I found great benefit, however, from the
                        chafing, and so did the Lieutenant and Purser. After a little time, our
                        generous benefactress ordered some bales of Indian cloth to be brought out,
                        with which she clothed me, and all that were with me, according to the
                        fashion of the country. At first I declined the acceptance of this favour,
                        but being unwilling not to seem pleased with what was intended to please me,
                        I acquiesced. When we went away, she ordered a very large sow, big with
                        young, to be taken down to the boat, and accompanied us thither herself. She
                        had given directions to her people to carry me, as they had done when I
                        came, but as I chose rather to walk, she took me by the arm, and whenever we
                        came to a plash of water or dirt, she lifted me over with as <em>--page 464--
        </em>little trouble as it would have cost me to have lifted over a child if I
                        had been well.</span>
      </p>
                <p>The next morning
                    <span class="contact">I sent her by the gunner, six
                        hatchets, six bill-hooks, and several other things; and when he returned, he
                        told me that he found her giving an entertainment to a great number of
                        people, which, he supposed, could not be less than a thousand. The messes
                        were all brought to her by the servants that prepared them, the meat being
                        put into the shells of cocoa nuts, and the shells into wooden trays,
                        somewhat like those used by our butchers, and she distributed them with her
                        own hands to the guests, who were seated in rows round the great house. When
                        this was done, she sat down herself, upon a place somewhat elevated above
                        the rest, and two women, placing themselves one on each side of her, fed
                        her, she opening her mouth as they brought their hands up with the food.
                        When she saw the gunner, she ordered a mess for him; he could not certainly
                        tell what it was, but he believed it to be fowl picked small, with apples
                        cut among it, and seasoned with salt water; it was, however, very well
                        tasted. She accepted the things that I sent her, and seemed to be much
                        pleased with them. After this correspondence was established with the queen,
                        provisions of every kind became much more plenty at market;</span>
                    <span class="trade">but though fowls and hogs were every day
                        brought in, we were still obliged to pay more for them than at the first,
                        the market having been spoiled by the nails which our men had stolen and
                        given to the women; I therefore gave orders that every man should be
                        searched before he went on shore, and that no woman should be suffered to
                        cross the river.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="contact">On the 14th,
                        the gunner being on shore to trade, perceived an old woman on the other side
                        of the river, weeping <em>--page 465--
        </em>bitterly: when she saw that she had drawn
                        his attention upon her, she sent a young man, who stood by her, over the
                        river to him, with a branch of the plantain tree in his hand. When he came
                        up, he made a long speech, and then laid down his bough at the gunner's
                        feet: after this he went back and brought over the old woman, another man at
                        the same time bringing over two large fat hogs. The woman looked round upon
                        our people with great attention, fixing her eyes sometimes upon one, and
                        sometimes upon another, and at last burst into tears. The young man who
                        brought her over the river, perceiving the gunner's concern and
                        astonishment, made another speech, longer than the first: still, however,
                        the woman's distress was a mystery, but at length she made him understand
                        that her husband, and three of her sons, had been killed in the attack of
                        the ship. During this explanation, she was to affected that at last she sunk
                        down unable to speak, and the two young men, who endeavoured to support her,
                        appeared to be nearly in the same condition: they were probably two more of
                        her sons, or some very near relations. The gunner did all in his power to
                        sooth and comfort her, and when she had in some measure recovered her
                        recollection, she ordered the two hogs to be delivered to him, and gave him
                        her hand in token of friendship, but would accept nothing in return, though
                        he offered her ten times as much as would have purchased the hogs at
                        market.</span>
      </p>
                <p>The next morning, I sent the Second Lieutenant,
                    with all the boats, and sixty men, to the westward, to look at the country, and
                    try what was to be got. <span class="contact">About noon he
                        returned, having marched along the shore near six miles. He found the
                        country very pleasant and populous, and abounding as well with hogs and
                        fowls, as fruit, and other vegetables of various kinds. The inhabitants
                        offered him no molestation, <em>--page 466--
        </em>but did not seem willing to part
                        with any of the provisions which our people were most desirous to purchase:
                        they gave them, however, a few cocoa-nuts and plantains, and at length sold
                        them nine hogs and a few fowls. <span class="trade">The
                            Lieutenant was of opinion, that they might be brought to trade freely by
                            degrees, but the distance from the ship was so great, that too many men
                            would be necessary for a guard.</span> He saw a great number of very large
                        canoes upon the beach, and some that were building. He observed that all
                        their tools were made of stone, shells, and bone, and very justly inferred,
                        that they had no metal of any kind. He found no quadrupeds among them,
                        besides hogs and dogs, nor any earthen vessel, so that all their food is
                        either baked or roasted. Having no vessel in which water could be subjected
                        to the action of fire, they had no more idea that it could be made hot, than
                        that it could be made solid.</span>
                    <span class="contact">As the queen was one morning at
                        breakfast with us on board the ship, one of her attendants, a man of some
                        note, and one of those that we thought were priests, saw the Surgeon fill
                        the teapot by turning the cock of an urn that stood upon the table: having
                        remarked this with great curiosity and attention, he presently turned the
                        cock, and received the water upon his hand: as soon as he felt himself
                        scalded, he roared out, and began to dance about the cabbin with the most
                        extravagant and ridiculous expressions of pain and astonishment: the other
                        Indians, not being able to conceive what was the matter with him, stood
                        staring at him in amaze, and not without some mixture of terror. The
                        Surgeon, however, who had innocently been the cause of the mischief, applied
                        a remedy, though it was some time before the poor fellow was easy.</span>

                <p>On Thursday the 16th, <span class="health">Mr. Furneaux, my Second Lieutenant,
                        was taken very ill, which distressed me greatly, as <em>--page 467--

                        several days, but the natives made us understand, by signs, that the next
                        day she would be with us again.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="contact">Accordingly the next morning she came down to the beach,
                        and soon after a great number of people, whom we had never seen before,
                        brought to market provisions of every kind; and the gunner sent off fourteen
                        hogs, and fruit in great plenty.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="contact">In the afternoon of the next day, the queen came on board, with a
                        present of two large hogs, for she never condescended to barter, and in the
                        evening she returned on shore. I sent a present with her, by the Master, and
                        as soon as they landed, she took him by the hand, and having made a long
                        speech to she people that flocked round them, she led him to her house,
                        where she clothed him, as she had before done me, according to the fashion
                        of the country.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="contact">The next
                            morning, he sent off a greater quantity of stock than we had ever
                        procured in one day before; it consisted of forty-eight hogs and pigs, four
                        dozen of fowls, with bread-fruit, bananas, apples, and cocoa-nuts, almost
                        without number.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="trade">On the 20th, we
                        continued to trade with good success,</span>
                    <span class="theft">but in the afternoon it was discovered that
                            Francis Pinckney, one of the seamen, had drawn the
                        cleats to which the main sheet was belayed, and, after stealing the spikes,
                        thrown them over board.</span>
                    <span class="punishment">Having secured the offender, I called all
                        the people together upon the deck, and after taking some pains to explain
                        his crime, with all its aggravations, I ordered that he should be whipped
                        with nettles while he ran <em>--page 468--
        </em>the gauntlet thrice round the deck:
                        my rhetoric, however, had very little effect, for most of the crew being
                        equally criminal with himself, he was handled so tenderly, that others were
                        rather encouraged to repeat the offence by the hope of impunity, than
                        deterred by the fear of punishment. To preserve the ship, therefore, from
                        being pulled to pieces, and the price of refreshments from being raised so
                        high as soon to exhaust our articles of trade, I ordered that no man, except
                        the wooders and waterers, with their guard, should be permitted to go on
                        shore.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="contact">On the
                            21st, the queen came again on board, and brought several large
                        hogs as a present, for which, as usual, she would accept of no return. When
                        she was about to leave the ship, she expressed a desire that I should go on
                        shore with her, to which I consented, taking several of the officers with
                        me. When we arrived at her house, she made us all sit down, and taking off
                        my hat, she tied to it a bunch or tuft of feathers of various colours, such
                        as I had seen no person on shore wear but herself, which produced by no
                        means a disagreeable effect. She also tied round my hat, and the hats of
                        those who were with me, wreaths of braided or plaited hair, and gave us to
                        understand that both the hair and workmanship were her own: she also
                        presented us with some matts, that were very curiously wrought. In the
                        evening she accompanied us back to the beach, and when we were getting into
                        the boat, she put on board a fine large sow, big with young, and a great
                        quantity of fruit. As we were parting, I made signs that I should quit the
                        island in seven days: she immediately comprehended my meaning, and made
                        signs that I should stay twenty days; that I should go two days journey into
                        the country, stay there a few days, bring down plenty of hogs and poultry,
                        and after that leave the island. I again made signs that I must go in seven
                        days; <em>--page 469--
        </em>upon which she burst into tears, and it was not without
                        great difficulty that she was pacified.</span>

                <p>
         <span class="provisions">The next
                            morning, the gunner sent off no less than twenty hogs, with great
                        plenty of fruit. Our decks were now quite full of hogs and poultry, of which
                        we killed only the small ones, and kept the others for sea stores;</span> we
                    found, however, to our great mortification, that neither the fowls nor the hogs
                    could, without great difficulty, be brought to eat any thing but fruit, which
                    made it necessary to kill them faster than we should otherwise have done: two,
                    however, a boar and a sow, were brought alive to England,
                    of which I made a present to Mr. Stephens, Secretary to the
                    Admiralty; the sow afterwards died in pigging, but the boar is still alive.</p>
                <p>On the 23d, <span class="weather">we
                        had very heavy rain, with a storm of wind that blew down several trees on
                        shore, though very little of it was felt where the ship lay.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="contact">The next day,
                        I sent the old man, who had been of great service to the gunner at the
                        market-tent, another iron pot, some hatchets and bills, and a piece of
                        cloth.</span>
                    <span class="contact">I also sent the queen two
                        turkies, two geese, three Guinea hens, a cat big with kitten, some china,
                        looking-glasses, glass bottles, shirts, needles, thread, cloth, ribands,
                        peas, some small white kidney beans, called callivances, and about sixteen
                        different sorts of garden seeds, and a shovel, besides a considerable
                        quantity of cutlery wares, consisting of knives, scissars, bill-hooks, and
                        other things. We had already planted several sorts of the garden seeds, and
                        some peas in several places, and had the pleasure to see them come up in a
                        very flourishing state, yet there were no remains of them when Captain Cook
                        left the island. I sent her also two iron pots, and a few spoons. In return
                        for these things, the gunner brought off eighteen hogs, and some
                    fruit.</span>

                <em>--page 470--
        </em>
                <p>In the morning of the 25th, I ordered
                        Mr. Gore, one of the mates, with all the marines, forty
                    seamen, and four midshipmen, to go up the valley by the river as high as they
                    could, and examine the soil and produce of the country, noting the trees and
                    plants which they should find, and when they saw any stream from the mountains,
                    to trace it to its source, and observe whether it was tinctured with any mineral
                    or ore. I cautioned them also to keep continually upon their guard against the
                    natives, and directed them to make a fire, as a signal, if they should be
                    attacked. At the same time, I took a guard on shore, and erected a tent on a
                    point of land, to observe an eclipse of the sun, which, the morning being very
                    clear, was done with great accuracy. The immersion began, by true time, at 6
                    hours 51 minutes 50 seconds. The emersion, by true time, was at 8 hours 1 minute
                    0 seconds. The duration of the eclipse was 1 hour 9 minutes 10 seconds. The
                    latitude of the point, on which the observation was made, was <span class="geo">17° 30′ S</span>. the sun's declination was 19° 40′ N. and the variation of
                    the needle 5° 36′ E.</p>
                <p>
         <span class="contact">After the observation was taken,
                        I went to the queen's house, and shewed her the telescope, which was a
                        reflector. After she had admired its structure, I endeavoured to make her
                        comprehend its use, and fixing it so as to command several distant objects,
                        with which she was well acquainted, but which could not be distinguished
                        with the naked eye, I made her look through it. As soon as the saw them, she
                        started back with astonishment, and directing her eye as the glass was
                        pointed, stood some time motionless and silent; she then looked through the
                        glass again, and again sought in vain, with the naked eye, for the objects
                        which it discovered. As they by turns vanished and re-appeared, her <em>--page 471--
        </em>countenance and gestures expressed a mixture of wonder and
                        delight which no language can describe. When the glass was removed, I
                        invited her, and several of the Chiefs that were with her, to go with me on
                        board the ship, in which I had a view to the security of the party that I
                        had sent out; for I thought that while the queen, and the principal people
                        were known to be in my power, nothing would be attempted against any person
                        belonging to the ship on shore. When we got on board, I ordered a good
                        dinner for their entertainment, but the queen would neither eat nor drink;
                        the people that were with her eat very heartily of whatever was set before
                        them, but would drink only plain water.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="contact">In the evening our people
                        returned from their excursion, and came down to the beach, upon which I put
                        the queen and her attendants into the boats, and sent them on shore. As she
                        was going over the ship's side, she asked, by signs, whether I still
                        persisted in my resolution of leaving the island at the time I had fixed;
                        and when I made her understand that it was impossible I should stay longer,
                        she expressed her regret by a flood of tears, which for a while took away
                        her speech. As soon as her passion subsided, she told me that she would come
                        on board again the next day; and thus we parted.</span>

                <p>AFTER the mate came on board, he gave me a written account of his expedition, to
                    the following effect:</p>
                <p>
         <span class="scout">"At four o'clock in the
                            morning, of Saturday the 25th of
                            June, I landed, with four midshipmen, a serjeant and twelve
                        marines, and twenty-four seamen, all armed, besides four who carried
                        hatchets and other articles of traffick, and four who were loaded with
                        ammunition and provisions, the rest being left with the boat: every man had
                        his day's allowance of brandy, and the hatchet men two small kegs, to give
                        out when I should think proper.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="contact">"As soon as I got on shore, I called upon our
                        old man, and took him with us: we then followed the course of the river in
                        two parties, one marching on each side. For the first two miles it flowed
                        through a valley of considerable width, in which were many habitations, with
                        gardens walled in, and abundance of hogs, poultry, and fruit; the soil here
                        seemed to be a rich fat earth, and was of a blackish colour. After this the
                        valley became very narrow, and the ground rising abruptly on one side of the
                        river, we were all obliged to march on the other. Where the stream was
                        precipitated from the hills, channels had been cut to lead the water into
                        gardens and plantations of fruit trees: in these gardens we found an herb
                        which had never been brought down to the <em>--page 473--
        </em> water-side, and which
                        we perceived the inhabitants eat raw. I tasted it, and found it pleasant,
                        its flavour somewhat resembling that of the West Indian spinnage, called
                        Calleloor, though its leaf was very different. The ground was fenced off so
                        as to make a very pretty appearance; the bread-fruit and apple trees were
                        planted in rows on the declivity of the hills, and the cocoa nut and
                        plantain, which require more moisture, on the level ground: under the trees,
                        both on the sides and at the foot of the hills, there was very good grass,
                        but no underwood. As we advanced, the windings of the stream became
                        innumerable, the hills on each side swelled into mountains, and vast crags
                        every where projected over our heads. Travelling now became difficult, and
                        when we had proceeded about four miles, the road for the last mile having
                        been very bad, we sat down to rest ourselves, and take the refreshment of
                        our breakfast; we ranged ourselves upon the ground under a large apple tree,
                        in a very pleasant spot; but just as we were about to begin our repast, we
                        were suddenly alarmed by a confused sound of many voices, and a great
                        shouting, and presently afterwards saw a multitude of men, women, and
                        children upon the hill above us; our old man seeing us rise hastily, and
                        look to our arms, beckoned to us to sit still, and immediately went up to
                        the people that had surprised us. As soon as he joined them they were
                        silent, and soon after disappeared; in a short time, however, they returned,
                        and brought with them a large hog ready roasted, with plenty of bread-fruit,
                        yams, and other refreshments, which they gave to the old man, who
                        distributed them among our people. In return for this treat, I gave them
                        some nails, buttons, and other things, with which they were greatly
                        delighted. After this we proceeded up the valley as far as we could,
                        searching all the runs of water, and all the places where water had run, for
                            <em>--page 474--
        </em> appearances of metal or ore, but could find none, except
                        what I have brought back with me. I shewed all the people that we met with,
                        the piece of saltpetre which had been picked up in the island, and which I
                        had taken with me for that purpose, but none of them took any notice of it,
                        nor could I learn from them any thing about it. The old man began now to be
                        weary, and there being a mountain before us, he made signs that he would go
                        home: before he left us, however, he made the people who had so liberally
                        supplied us with provisions, take the baggage, with the fruit that had not
                        been eaten, and some cocoa nut-shells full of fresh water, and made signs
                        that they should follow us up the side of the mountain. As soon as he was
                        gone, they gathered green branches from the neighbouring trees, and with
                        many ceremonies, of which we did not know the meaning, laid them down before
                        us: after this they took some small berries with which they painted
                        themselves red, and the bark of a tree that contained a yellow juice, with
                        which they stained their garments in different parts. We began to climb the
                        mountain while our old man was still in sight, and he, perceiving that we
                        made our way with difficulty through the weeds and brush-wood, which grew
                        very thick, turned back, and said something to the natives in a firm loud
                        tone; upon which twenty or thirty of the men went before us, and cleared us
                        a very good path; they also refreshed us with water and fruit as we went
                        along, and assisted us to climb the most difficult places, which we should
                        otherwise have found altogether impracticable. We began to ascend this hill
                        at the distance of about six miles from the place where we landed, and I
                        reckoned the top of it to be near a mile above the river that runs through
                        the valley below. When we arrived at the summit, we again sat down to rest
                        and refresh ourselves. While we were <em>--page 475--
        </em> climbing we flattered
                        ourselves that from the top we should command the whole island, but we now
                        saw mountains before us so much higher than our situation, that with respect
                        to them we appeared to be in a valley; towards the ship indeed the view was
                        enchanting: the sides of the hills were beautifully clothed with wood,
                        villages were every where interspersed, and the vallies between them
                        afforded a still richer prospect; the houses stood thicker, and the verdure
                        was more luxuriant. We saw very few habitations above us, but discovered
                        smoke in many places ascending from between the highest hills that were in
                        sight, and therefore I conjecture that the most elevated parts of the
                        country are by no means without inhabitants. As we ascended the mountain, we
                        saw many springs gush from fissures on the side of it, and when we had
                        reached the summit, we found many houses that we did not discover as we
                        passed them. No part of these mountains is naked; the summits of the highest
                        that we could see were crowned with wood, but of what kind I know not: those
                        that were of the same height with that which we had climbed, were woody on
                        the sides, but on the summit were rocky and covered with fern. Upon the
                        flats that appeared below these, there grew a sedgy kind of grass and weeds:
                        in general the soil here, as well as in the valley, seemed to be rich. We
                        saw several bushes of sugar-cane, which was very large and very good,
                        growing wild, without the least culture. I likewise found ginger and
                        turmerick, and have brought samples of both, but could not procure seeds of
                        any tree, most of them being in blossom. After traversing the top of this
                        mountain to a good distance, I found a tree exactly like a fern, except that
                        it was 14 or 15 feet high. This tree I cut down, and found the inside of it
                        also like a fern: I would have brought a piece of it with me, but found it
                        too cumbersome, and I knew not <em>--page 476--
        </em> what difficulties we might meet
                        with before we got back to the ship, which we judged to be now at a great
                        distance. After having again recruited our strength by refreshment and rest,
                        we began to descend the mountain, being still attended by the people to
                        whose care we had been recommended by our old man. We kept our general
                        direction towards the ship, but sometimes deviated a little to the right and
                        left in the plains and vallies, when we saw any houses that were pleasantly
                        situated, the inhabitants being every where ready to accommodate us with
                        whatever they had. We saw no beast, except a few hogs, nor any birds, except
                        parrots, parroquets, and green doves; by the river, however, there was
                        plenty of ducks, and every place that was planted and cultivated, appeared
                        to flourish with great luxuriance, though in the midst of what had the
                        appearance of barren ground. I planted the stones of peaches, cherries, and
                        plums, with a great variety of garden seeds, where I thought it was most
                        probable that they would thrive, and limes, lemons, and oranges, in
                        situations which resembled those in which they are found in the West Indies.
                        In the afternoon, we arrived at a very pleasant spot, within about three
                        miles of the ship, where we procured two hogs and some fowls, which the
                        natives dressed for us very well, and with great expedition. Here we
                        continued till the cool of the evening, and then made the best of our way
                        for the ship, having liberally rewarded our guides, and the people who had
                        provided us so good a dinner. Our men behaved through the whole day with the
                        greatest decency and order, and we parted with our Indian friends in perfect
                        good-humour with each other."</span>

                            o'clock, the next morning, the
                        queen came on board according to her promise, with a present of hogs and
                        fowls, but went on shore again soon afterwards. This day, <em>--page 477--
        </em> the
                        Gunner sent off near thirty hogs, with great plenty of fowls and fruit. We
                        completed our wood and water, and got all ready for sea. More inhabitants
                        came down to the beach, from the inland country, than we had seen before,
                        and many of them appeared, by the respect that was paid them, to be of a
                        superior rank. About three o'clock in the afternoon, the queen came again
                        down to the beach, very well dressed, and followed by a great number of
                        people. Having crossed the river with her attendants and our old man, she
                        came once more on board the ship. She brought with her some very fine fruit,
                        and renewed her solicitation, that I would stay ten days longer, with great
                        earnestness, intimating that she would go into the country, and bring me
                        plenty of hogs, fowls, and fruit. I endeavoured to express a proper sense of
                        her kindness and bounty, but assured her that I should certainly sail the
                        next morning. This, as usual, threw her into tears, and after she recovered,
                        she enquired by signs when I should return: I endeavoured to express fifty
                        days, and she made signs for thirty: but the sign for fifty being constantly
                        repeated, she seemed satisfied. She stayed on board till night, and it was
                        then with the greatest difficulty that she could be prevailed upon to go on
                        shore. When she was told that the boat was ready, she threw herself down
                        upon the arm-chest, and wept a long time with an excess of passion that
                        could not be pacified; at last, however, though with the greatest
                        reluctance, she went into the boat, and was followed by her attendants and
                        the old man. The old man had often intimated that his son, a lad about
                        fourteen years of age, should go with us, and the boy seemed to be willing:
                        he had, however, now disappeared for two days; I enquired after him when I
                        first missed him, and the old man gave me to understand that he was gone
                        into the country to see his friends, and would return time <em>--page 478--
        </em>
                        enough to go with us; but I have reason to think that, when the time drew
                        near, the father's courage failed, and that to keep his child he secreted
                        him till the ship was gone, for we never saw him afterwards.</span>

                <p>
         <span class="contact">At break of day, on Monday the 27th, we unmoored, and at the same time I sent the
                        barge and cutter to fill the few water-casks that were now empty. When they
                        came near the shore, they saw, to their great surprise, the whole beach
                        covered with inhabitants, and having some doubt whether it would be prudent
                        to venture themselves among such a multitude, they were about to pull back
                        again for the ship.</span>
                    <span class="contact">As soon as this was perceived
                        from the shore, the queen came forward, and beckoned them; at the same time
                        guessing the reason of what had happened, she made the natives retire to the
                        other side of the river: the boats then proceeded to the shore, and filled
                        the casks, in the mean time she put some hogs and fruit on board, and when
                        they were putting off would fain have returned with them to the ship. The
                        officer, however, who had received orders to bring off none of the natives,
                        would not permit her; upon which she presently launched a double canoe, and
                        was rowed off by her own people. Her canoe was immediately followed by
                        fifteen or sixteen more, and all of them came up to the ship. The queen came
                        on board, but not being able to speak, she sat down and gave vent to her
                        passion by weeping. After she had been on board about an hour, a breeze
                        springing up, we weighed anchor and made sail. Finding it now necessary to
                        return into her canoe, she embraced us all in the most affectionate manner,
                        and with many tears; all her attendants also expressed great sorrow at our
                        departure. Soon after it fell calm, and I sent the boats a-head to tow, upon
                        which all the canoes returned to the ship, and that which had the queen on
                        board came up to the gun-room port, where her <em>--page 479--
        </em> people made it
                        fast. In a few minutes she came into the bow of her canoe, where she sat
                        weeping with inconsolable sorrow. I gave her many things which I thought
                        would be of great use to her, and some for ornament; she silently accepted
                        of all, but took little notice of any thing. About 10
                            o'clock we were got without the reef, and a fresh breeze
                        springing up, our Indian friends, and particularly the queen, once more bade
                        us farewel, with such tenderness of affection and grief, as filled both my
                        heart and my eyes.</span>

                <p>HAVING lain off this if island from the 24th of
                        June to the 27th of July, I shall now
                    give the best account of its inhabitants, with their manners and arts, that I
                    can; but having been in a very bad state of health the whole time, and for great
                    part of it confined to my bed, it will of necessity be much less accurate and
                    particular than I might otherwise have made it.</p>
                <p>
         <span class="natives">The inhabitants of this island
                        are a stout, well-made, active, and comely people. The stature of the men,
                        in general, is from five feet seven to five feet ten inches, though a few
                        individuals are taller, and a few shorter; that of the women from five feet
                        to five feet six. The complexion of the men is tawney, but those that go
                        upon the water are much redder than those who live on shore. Their hair in
                        general is black, but in some it is brown, in some red, and in others
                        flaxen, which is remarkable, because the hair of all other natives of Asia,
                        Africa, and America, is black, without a single exception. It is generally
                        tied up, either in one bunch, in the middle of the head, or in two, one on
                        each side, but some wear it loose, and it then curls very strongly: in the
                        children of both sexes it is generally flaxen. They have no combs, yet their
                        hair is very neatly dressed, and those who had combs from us, made good use
                        of them. It is a universal custom to anoint the head with cocoa-nut oil,
                            in<em>--page 481--
        </em> which a root has been scraped that smells something like
                        roses. The women are all handsome, and some of them extremely
                        beautiful.</span> Chastity does not seem to be considered as a virtue among
                    them, for they not only readily and openly trafficked with our people for
                    personal favours, but were brought down by their fathers and brothers for that
                    purpose: they were, however, conscious of the value of beauty, and the size of
                    the nail that was demanded for the enjoyment of the lady, was always in
                    proportion to her charms. The men who came down to the side of the river, at the
                    same time that they presented the girl, shewed a stick of the size of the nail
                    that was to be her price, and if our people agreed, she was sent over to them,
                    for the men were not permitted to cross the river. This commerce was carried on
                    a considerable time before the officers discovered it, for while some straggled
                    a little way to receive the lady, the others kept a look-out. When I was
                    acquainted with it, I no longer wondered that the ship was in danger of being
                    pulled to pieces for the nails and iron that held her together, which I had
                    before puzzled myself to account for in vain, the whole ship's company having
                    daily as much fresh provision and fruit as they could eat. Both men and women
                    are not only decently but gracefully clothed, in a kind of white cloth, that is
                    made of the bark of a shrub, and very much resembles coarse China paper. Their
                    dress consists of two pieces of this cloth: one of them, a hole having been made
                    in the middle to put the head through, hangs down from the shoulders to the
                    mid-leg before and behind; another piece, which is between four and five yards
                    long, and about one yard broad, they wrap round the body in a very easy manner.
                    This cloth is not woven, but is made, like paper, of the macerated fibres of an
                    inner bark, spread out and beaten together. Their ornaments are feathers,
                    flowers, <em>--page 482--
        </em> pieces of shells, and pearls the pearls are worn chiefly
                    by the women, from whom I purchased about two dozen of a small size: they were
                    of a good colour, but were all spoiled by boring. Mr. Furneaux saw several in
                    his excursion to the west, but he could purchase none with any thing he had to
                    offer. I observed, that it was here a universal custom both for men and women to
                    have the hinder part of their thighs and loins marked very thick with black
                    lines in various forms. These marks were made by striking the teeth of an
                    instrument, somewhat like a comb, just through the skin, and rubbing into the
                    punctures a kind of paste made of foot and oil, which leaves an indelible stain.
                    The boys and girls under twelve years of age, are not marked; but we observed a
                    few of the men whose legs were marked in chequers by the same method, and they
                    appeared to be persons of superior rank and authority. One of the principal
                    attendants upon the queen, appeared much more disposed to imitate our manners
                    than the rest; and our people, with whom he soon became a favourite,
                    distinguished him by the name of Jonathan. This man, Mr. Furneaux clothed
                    completely in an English dress, and it sat very easy upon him. Our officers were
                    always carried on shore, it being shoal water where we landed, and Jonathan,
                    assuming new state with his new finery, made some of his people carry him on
                    shore in the same manner. He very soon attempted to use a knife and fork at his
                    meals, but at first, when he had stuck a morsel upon his fork, and tried to feed
                    himself with that instrument, he could not guide it, but by the mere force of
                    habit his hand came to his mouth, and the victuals at the end of the fork went
                    away to his car.</p>

         <span class="natives">Their food consists of pork,
                        poultry, dog's flesh, and fish, bread-fruit, bananas, plantains, yams,
                        apples, and a four fruit which, though not pleasant by itself, gives an
                            agreeable<em>--page 483--
        </em> relish to roasted bread-fruit, with which it is
                        frequently beaten up. They have abundance of rats, but, as far as I could
                        discover, these make no part of their food. The river affords them good
                        mullet, but they are neither large nor in plenty. They find conchs, muscles,
                        and other shell-fish on the reef, which they gather at low water, and eat
                        raw with bread-fruit before they come on shore. They have also very fine
                        cray-fish, and they catch with lines, and hooks of mother of pearl, at a
                        little distance from the shore, parrotfish, groopers, and many other sorts,
                        of which they are so fond that we could seldom prevail upon them to sell us
                        a few at any price. They have also nets of an enormous size, with very small
                        meshes, and with these they catch abundance of small fish about the size of
                        sardines; but while they were using both nets and lines with great success,
                        we could not catch a single fish with either. We procured some of their
                        hooks and lines, but for want of their art we were still
                    disappointed.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="natives">The manner in which they dress
                        their food is this: they kindle a fire by rubbing the end of one piece of
                        dry wood upon the side of another, in the same manner as our carpenters whet
                        a chissel; then they dig a pit about half a foot deep, and two or three
                        yards in circumference: they pave the bottom with large pebble stones, which
                        they lay down very smooth and even, and then kindle a fire in it with dry
                        wood, leaves, and the husks of the cocoa-nut. When the stones are
                        sufficiently heated, they take out the embers, and rake up the ashes on
                        every side; then they cover the stones with a layer of green cocoa-nut-tree
                        leaves, and wrap up the animal that is to be dressed in the leaves of the
                        plantain; if it is a small hog they wrap it up whole, if a large one they
                        split it. When it is placed in the pit, they cover it with the hot embers,
                        and lay upon them bread-fruit and yams, which are<em>--page 484--
        </em> also wrapped
                        up in the leaves of the plantain; over these they spread the remainder of
                        the embers, mixing among them some of the hot stones, with more
                        cocoa-nut-tree leaves upon them, and then close all up with earth, so that
                        the heat is kept in. After a time proportioned to the size of what is
                        dressing, the oven is opened, and the meat taken out, which is tender, full
                        of gravy, and, in my opinion, better in every respect than when it is
                        dressed any other way. Excepting the fruit, they have no sauce but salt
                        water, nor any knives but shells, with which they carve very dexterously,
                        always cutting from them. It is impossible to describe the astonishment they
                        expressed when they saw the Gunner, who, while he kept the market, used to
                        dine on shore, dress his pork and poultry by boiling them in a pot, having,
                        as I have before observed, no vessel that would bear the fire, they had no
                        idea of hot water or its effects: but from the time that the old man was in
                        possession of an iron pot, he and his friends eat boiled meat every day. The
                        iron pots which I afterwards gave to the queen, and several of the Chiefs,
                        were also in constant use, and brought as many people together, as a monster
                        or a puppet-show in a country fair. They appeared to have no liquor for
                        drinking but water, and to be happily ignorant of the art of fermenting the
                        juice of any vegetable, so as to give it an intoxicating quality: they have,
                        as has been already observed, the sugarcane, but they seemed to make no
                        other use of it than to chew, which they do not do habitually, but only
                        break a piece off when they happen to pass by a place where it is
                        growing.</span>

         <span class="natives">Of their domestic life and
                        amusements, we had not sufficient opportunity to obtain much knowlege, but
                        they appear sometimes to have wars with each other, not only from their
                        weapons, but the scars with which many of them were<em>--page 485--
        </em> marked, and
                        some of which appeared to be the remains of very considerable wounds, made
                        with stones, bludgeons, or some other obtuse weapon: by these scars also
                        they appear to be no inconsiderable proficients in surgery, of which indeed
                        we happened to have more direct evidence. One of our seamen, when he was on
                        shore, run a large splinter into his foot, and the Surgeon being on board,
                        one of his comrades endeavoured to take it out with a penknife; but after
                        putting the poor fellow to a good deal of pain, was obliged to give it over.
                        Our good old Indian, who happened to be present, then called over one of his
                        countrymen that was standing on the opposite side of the river, who having
                        looked at the seaman's foot, went immediately down to the beach, and taking
                        up a shell, broke it to a point with his teeth; with this instrument, in
                        little more than a minute, he laid open the place, and extracted the
                        splinter; in the mean time the old man, who, as soon as he had called the
                        other over, went a little way into the wood, returned with some gum, which
                        he applied to the wound upon a piece of the cloth that was wrapped round
                        him, and in two days time it was perfectly healed. We afterwards learned
                        that this gum was produced by the apple tree, and our Surgeon procured some
                        of it, and used it as a vulnerary balsam with great success.</span>

         <span class="natives">The habitations of these happy
                        people I have described already; and besides these, we saw several sheds
                        inclosed within a wall, on the outside of which there were several uncouth
                        figures of men, women, hogs, and dogs, carved on posts, that were driven
                        into the ground. Several of the natives were from time to time seen to enter
                        these places, with a slow pace and dejected countenance, from which we
                        conjectured that they were repositories of the dead. The area within the
                        walls of these places, was generally well paved<em>--page 486--
        </em> with large
                        round stones, but it appeared not to be much trodden, for the grass every
                        where grew up between them. I endeavoured, with particular attention, to
                        discover whether they had a religious worship among them, but never could
                        find the least traces of any.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="natives">The boats or canoes of these
                        people, are of three different sorts. Some are made out of a single tree,
                        and carry from two to six men: these are used chiefly for fishing, and we
                        constantly saw many of them busy upon the reef: some were constructed of
                        planks, very dexterously sewed together: these were of different sizes, and
                        would carry from ten to forty men. Two of them were generally lashed
                        together, and two masts set up between them; if they were single, they had
                        an out-rigger on one side, and only one mast in the middle. With these
                        vessels they sail far beyond the sight of land, probably to other islands,
                        and bring home plantains, bananas, and yams, which seem also to be more
                        plenty upon other parts of this island, than that off which the ship lay. A
                        third sort seem to be intended principally for pleasure and show: they are
                        very large, but have no sail, and in shape resemble the gondolas of Venice:
                        the middle is covered with a large awning, and some of the people sit upon
                        it, some under it. None of these vessels came near the ship, except on the
                        first and second day after our arrival; but we saw, three or four times a
                        week, a procession of eight or ten of them passing at a distance, with
                        streamers flying, and a great number of small canoes attending them, while
                        many hundreds of people ran abreast of them along the shore. They generally
                        rowed to the outward point of a reef which lay about four miles to the
                        westward of us, where they stayed about an hour, and then returned. These
                        processions, however, are never made but in fine weather, and all<em>--page 487--
        </em> the people on board are dressed; though in the other canoes they have
                        only a piece of cloth wrapped round their middle. Those who rowed and
                        steered were dressed in white; those who sat upon the awning and under it in
                        white and red, and two men who were mounted on the prow of each vessel, were
                        dressed in red only. We sometimes went out to observe them in our boats, and
                        though we were never nearer than a mile, we saw them with our glasses as
                        distinctly as if we had been upon the spot.</span>
      </p>
                <p>
         <span class="natives">The plank of which these vessels
                        are constructed, is made by splitting a tree, with the grain, into as many
                        thin pieces as they can. They first fell the tree with a kind of hatchet, or
                        adze, made of a tough greenish kind of stone, very dexterously fitted into a
                        handle; it is then cut into such lengths as are required for the plank, one
                        end of which is heated till it begins to crack, and then with wedges of hard
                        wood they split it down: some of these planks are two feet broad, and from
                        15 to 20 feet long. The sides are smoothed with adzes of the same materials
                        and construction, but of a smaller size. Six or eight men are sometimes at
                        work upon the same plank together, and, as their tools presently lose their
                        edge, every man has by him a cocoa nut-shell filled with water, and a flat
                        stone, with which he sharpens his adze almost every minute. These planks are
                        generally brought to the thickness of about an inch, and are afterwards
                        fitted to the boat with the same exactness that would be expected from an
                        expert joiner. To fasten these planks together, holes are bored with a piece
                        of bone that is fixed into a stick for that purpose, a use to which our
                        nails were afterwards applied with great advantage, and through these holes
                        a kind of plaited cordage is passed, so as to hold the planks strongly
                        together: the seams are caulked with dried rushes, and the whole outside of
                        the vessel is paid with a<em>--page 488--
        </em> gummy juice, which some of their
                        trees produce in great plenty, and which is a very good succedaneum for
                        pitch.</span>
      </p>
                <p>The wood which they use for their large canoes, is that of the apple tree, which
                    grows very tall and strait. Several of them that we measured, were near eight
                    feet in the girth, and from 20 to 40 to the branches, with very little
                    diminution in the size. Our carpenter said, that in other respects it was not a
                    good wood for the purpose, being very light. The small canoes are nothing more
                    than the hollowed trunk of the bread-fruit tree, which is still more light and
                    spongy. The trunk of the bread-fruit tree is six feet in girth, and about 20
                    feet to the branches.</p>
                <p>Their principal weapons are stones, thrown either with the hand or sling, and
                    bludgeons; for though they have bows and arrows, the arrows are only fit to
                    knock down a bird, none of them being pointed, but headed only with a round
                    stone.</p>
                <p>I did not see one turtle all the while I lay off this island, but upon shewing
                    some small ones which I brought from Queen Charlotte's
                        Island, to the inhabitants, they made signs that they had them
                    of a much larger size. I very much regretted my having lost our he-goat, which
                    died soon after we left Saint Iago, and that neither of
                    our she-goats, of which we had two, were with kid. If the he-goat had lived, I
                    would have put them all on shore at this place, and I would have left a she-goat
                    here if either of them had been with kid; and I doubt not, but that in a few
                    years they would have stocked the island.</p>

         <span class="animalsighting">The climate here appears to be very
                        good, and the island to be one of the most healthy as well as delightful
                        spots in the world. We saw no appearance of disease among the inhabitants.
                        The hills are covered with wood, and the vallies<em>--page 489--
        </em> with herbage;
                        and the air in general is so pure, that, notwithstanding the heat, our flesh
                        meat kept very well two days, and our fish one. We met with no frog, toad,
                        scorpion, centipied, or serpent of any kind: and the only troublesome
                        insects that we saw were ants, of which there were but few.</span>

                <p>
         <span class="trade">The south-east part of the island seems to be
                        better cultivated and inhabited than where we lay, for we saw every day
                        boats come round from thence laden with plantains and other fruit, and we
                        always found greater plenty, and a lower price, soon after their arrival,
                        than before.</span>
      </p>
                <p>The tide rises and falls very little, and being governed by the winds, is very
                    uncertain; though they generally blow from the E. to the S. S. E. and for the
                    most part a pleasant breeze.</p>

         <span class="health">The benefit that we received while we lay off
                        this island, with respect to the health of the ship's company, was beyond
                        our most sanguine expectations, for we had not now an invalid on board,
                        except the two Lieutenants and myself, and we were recovering, though still

                        commerce with great numbers of the women, there is the greatest probability
                        that it was not then known in the country. It was, however, found here by
                            Captain Cook, in the Endeavour, and as no European
                        vessel is known to have visited this island before Captain
                            Cook's arrival, but the Dolphin, and the Boudeuse and Etoil,
                        commanded by M. Bougainville, the reproach of having contaminated with that
                        dreadful pest, a race of happy people, to whom its miseries had till then
                        been unknown, must be due either to him or to me, to England or to France;
                        and I think myself happy to be able to exculpate myself and my country
                        beyond the possibility of doubt.</span>

         <span class="health">It is well known, that the Surgeon on board his
                        Majesty's ships keeps a list of the persons who are sick on board,
                        specifying their diseases, and the times when they came under his care, and
                        when they were discharged. It happened that I was once at the pay-table on
                        board a ship, when several sailors objected to the payment of the Surgeon,
                        alleging, that although he had discharged them from the list, and reported
                        them to be cured, yet their cure was incomplete. From this time, it has been
                        my constant practice when the Surgeon reported a man to be cured, who had
                        been upon the sick list, to call the man before me, and ask him whether the
                        report was true: if he alleged that any symptoms of his complaint remained,
                        I continued him upon the list; if not, I required him, as a confirmation of
                        the Surgeon's report, to sign the book, which was always done in my
                        presence. A copy of the sick list on board the Dolphin, during this voyage,
                        signed by every man in my presence, when he was discharged well, in
                        confirmation of the Surgeon's report, written in my own hand, and confirmed
                        by my affidavit, I have deposited in the Admiralty; by which it appears,
                        that the last man on board the ship, in her voyage outward, who was upon the
                        sick list for the venereal disease, except one who was sent to
                            England in the Store ship, was discharged cured,
                        and signed the book on the 27th of December
                            1766, near six months before our arrival at
                            Otaheite, which was on the 19th of June 1767; and that the first man who
                        was upon the list for that disease, in our return home, was entered on the
                            26th of February 1768, six months after
                        we left the island, which was on the 26th of July
                            1767, so that the ship's company was intirely free fourteen
                        months within one day, the very middle of which time we spent at
                            Otaheite;<span class="health"> and
                            the man who was first entered as a venereal patient, on our return home,
                            was known to have contracted the disease at the Cape of Good
                                Hope, where we then lay.</span>
