         <h1>Bibliography Collection of English References to Pacific Topics</h1>
         <hr/>
         <h2> Introduction:</h2>
         <p>This bibliography represents a collaborative effort to compile a
                    list of works published from 1774 to 1797 that contains references to people,
                    places, interactions, events, and objects relevant to Pacific voyages during
                    this time period. Excerpts have been provided from each of these works to
                    illustrate the impact the Pacific voyages of the eighteenth century had on the
                    English-speaking world. </p>
         <p>This pie graph helps to summarize our counts of the kinds of cultural interactions
            our team marked in the passages we excerpted for the bibliography. Most of the cultural interactions, as marked by the collaborators, appeared to register peaceful experiences between Pacific and English-speaking peoples (27% of interactions). However, 21% of these interactions are also marked as points of conflict. The graph  and the following bibliography help to demonstrate how Atlantic media was processing early contact experiences in the Pacific: what topics they foregrounded for interest and cultural entertainment.</p>

                        (according to this author) tendencies toward <span class="concept">monotheism</span>. Passage: " The <span class="character">North-American
                            savages</span> have all of them a notion of a supreme Deity, creator
                        and governor of the world, and of inferior deities, some good, some ill.
                        These are supposed to have bodies, and to live much as men do, but without
                        being subjected to any distress. The same creed prevails among the negroes
                        of <span class="place">Benin</span> and <span class="place">Congo</span>, among the
                        people of <span class="place">New Zeland</span>, among the inhabitants of

                        the <span class="place">Molucca islands</span>, and of the <span class="place">Caribbee
                            islands</span>. The <span class="character">Chingulese</span>, a tribe in the
                        island of <span class="place">Ceylon</span>, acknowledge one <span class="myth">God</span> creator of the universe, with subordinate deities who act as
                        his deputies: agriculture is the peculiar province of one, navigation of
                        another. The creed of the <span class="character">Tonquinese</span> is nearly the same.
                        The inhabitants of <span class="place">Otaheite</span>, termed <span class="place">King
