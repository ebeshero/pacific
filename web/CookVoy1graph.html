            <p>In this pie chart we have collected all of the interactions in Book I, Chapters X through XV of <a href="Cookvoy1.html">Captain Cook's first voyage into the Pacific</a> and have broken it down into what types of interactions were seen in those chapters (on Tahiti and the Transit of Venus). The types of interactions we graphed are conflicts involving theft, conflicts involving bloodshed, trade, friendships, ceremonies and imperial behavior by Captain Cook and his crew such as introducing non-native species to the Pacific islands. Below our pie chart we have broken down the interactions by every two chapters to get an even better look at what kind of interaction were most common and in which chapters they appear. Our graph and tables only represent the types of interactions, although an interesting idea for the future that was given to us by Dr. Beshero-Bondar would be to chart what kinds of objects were involved in interactions such as theft.  </p>
