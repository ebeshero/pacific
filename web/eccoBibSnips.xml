                    list of works published from 1774 to 1797 that contains references to people,
                    places, interactions, events, and objects relevant to Pacific voyages during
                    this time period. Excerpts have been provided from each of these works to
                    illustrate the impact the Pacific voyages of the eighteenth century had on the

                        Attempt to address a philosophical question about whether people are
                        naturally sociable or antisocial and brutally violent. "<rs type="interact"

                            where there is plenty of game, and where the sense of property is faint,
                            mutual affection prevails, because there is no cause of discord; and <rs

                            hunters and fishers to this day; and such is the condition of all brute
                            animals that live in society, as mentioned above. The island
                                <placeName>Otaheite</placeName> is divided into many small <rs

                            for society than any other known nation. Sweetness of temper, and love
                            to do good, form their character. They never commit acts of violence:
                                <rs type="concept">war</rs> they have no notion of; and it is a
                            proverb among them, That a man never puts a man to death.
                                <persName>Plato</persName> places the seat of <rs type="concept"

                        flocks and herds, proceeds to appropriate land, and is not satisfied without
                        matters of <rs type="concept">luxury</rs> over and above; <rs type="concept"
                            >selfishness</rs> and <rs type="concept">pride</rs> gain ground, and

                            >monotheism</rs>. Passage: " The <orgName>North-American
                            savages</orgName> have all of them a notion of a supreme Deity, creator

                        These are supposed to have bodies, and to live much as men do, but without
                        being subjected to any distress. The same creed prevails among the negroes
                        of <placeName>Benin</placeName> and <placeName>Congo</placeName>, among the
