<description>As the journal of that voyage has been suppressed in France, I shall here insert such particulars as were communicated to us by several French officers at the Cape of Good Hope. M. de Kerguelen, a lieutenant in the French navy, commanding the vessel (flute) la Fortune, and having with him a smaller vessel (gabarre) le Gros Ventre, commanded by M. de St. Allouarn, sailed from the Isle of France or Mauritius the latter end of 1771. On the 13th of January 1772, he saw two isles, which he called the Isles of Fortune; and the next morning one more, which from its shape they called Isle Ronde. Almost about the same time, M. de Kerguelen saw land, of a considerable extent and height, upon which he sent one of the officers of his ship a-head in the cutter to sound. But the wind blowing fresh, M. de St. Allouarn in the Gros Ventre shot ahead of the boat, and finding a bay, which he called the Gros Ventre's bay sent his own yawl to take possession of the land which was performed with the utmost difficulty. Both the boats then returned aboard the Gros Ventre, and the cutter was cut adrift on account of the bad weather. M. de St. Allouarn then spent three days in quest of M. de Kerguelen, who had been driven sixty leagues to leeward, on account of his weak masts, and was returned towards the Isle of France. M. de St. Allouarn continued to take the bearings of this land, and doubled its northern extremity beyond which it tended to the south-eastward. In this direction he coasted it for the space of twenty leagues, and seeing it was very high, inaccessible, and destitute of trees, he left it, standing over to the coast of New Holland, from thence to Timor and Batavia, and at last back to the Isle of France, where he died soon after his arrival. On M. de Kerguelen's return to Europe, he was immediately sent out again with a 64 gun ship called the Roland, and the frigate l'Oiseau, captain Rosnevet; but after having just seen the land, which he had discovered in his former voyage, he returned without making farther discoveries. The northern coast of the land which he discovered, is situated in about 48° S.outh latitude, and about 82° E.ast longitude from Ferro, or 6 degrees east of the Isle of France, (i.e. in about 64° 20' east from Greenwich).</description>

<description>M. de Marion in his expedition of 1772, in January, fell in with small islands in three different places, about the latitude of 46.5° S. and 47.5° S. , and about the longitudes of 37°, 46.5° E. , and 48.5° E.ast from Greenwich. These islands were all of inconsiderable extent, high, rocky, destitute of trees, and almost entirely barren. M. de Marion had two ships under his command, one the Mascarin, captain Crozet, the other the Castrie, captain Du Clesmure. They proceeded to the southern extremity of New Holland, or Diemen's land, first seen by Tasman; and from thence to the bay of islands in New Zeeland, where M. de Marion was killed with 28 of his men by the natives, of which more shall be said in the sequel. After this loss M. de Crozet, on whom the command devolved, passed through the western part of the South Sea to the Philippinas, from whence he returned to the Isle de France. Agreeably to these accounts, the discoveries of the French voyagers have been laid down in an excellent [1773. February.]chart of the southern hemisphere, by M. de Vaugondy, under the direction of the duke de Croy, and published in March 1773.</description>

<description>On the 31st in the evening, our latitude being nearly that of 50° south, we passed by a large island of ice, which at that instant crumbled to pieces with a tremendous explosion. [Monday 1.]The next morning a bundle of sea weeds was seen floating past the sloop; and in the afternoon, captain Furneaux in the Adventure having hailed us, acquainted captain Cook that he had seen a number of divers, resembling those in the English seas, and had past a great bed of floating rock-weeds. In consequence of these observations we stood off and on during night, and continued an easterly course the next morning. [Tuesday 2.]We saw many petrels and black shear-waters, some rock-weed, and a single tern (sterna) or as the seamen call it an egg-bird, which had a forked tail. At noon we observed in 48° 36' south latitude, which was nearly the same in which the French discoveries are said to be situated. After noon we stood south-westward, but the next day the gale encreased to such a degree, as obliged us to hand our topsails, and stand on under the courses all night: however, at eight o'clock on the 4th, we found a smooth sea gain, and set more sail, changing our course to the north-westward at noon. On the 6th our latitude at noon was nearly 48° S.outh, about 60° E.ast from Greenwich, when not seeing any land, we gave over the attempt to stand in search of it, and directed our course once more to the south-eastward, to the main object of our voyage. The smoothness of the sea, whilst we had strong easterly gales, however persuaded us, that there was probably some land near us to the eastward, and the situation given to the French discoveries, in M. Vaugondy's late chart, has confirmed our supposition; for, according to it, we must have been at least 2 degrees of longitude to the west of it, on the second of February, when we were farthest to the east in the given latitude. Though we did not fall in with the land itself, yet we have done so much service to geography by our track, as to put it beyond a doubt, that the French discovery is a small island, and not, what it was supposed at first to be, the north cape of a great southern continent.</description>

<description>[Wednesd. 23.]On the 23d, the weather being mild and the wind very moderate, captain Furneaux came on board, and dined with us. He acquainted captain Cook, that all his people continued in good health, except one or two, who were infected with a nauseous disease, which is propagated by connections with the other sex. This information gave us great uneasiness, it being evident that the distemper had already reached New Zeeland, since our men must have received it there. Struck with the horrid consequences which this evil would entail on the New Zeelanders, we recapitulated the opportunities which those people had of catching the infection from Europeans. The first discoverer of this country, in 1642, Abel Janssen Tasman had not the least amicable intercourse with the inhabitants, and none of his people appear to have been ashore upon it. Captain Cook, the next navigator, who visited it in the Endeavour Bark, 1769 and 1770, came from O-Taheitee and the Society Isles where several of his people had contracted venereal complaints. However, as his passage lasted nearly two months, the surgeon reported, when they made the coast, that no man had any symptoms of the distemper about him. Notwithstanding this assurance captain Cook had the precaution, not to suffer any person to go on shore, who had been under cure, and might be suspected to have some latent remains of this infectious evil; and to preclude the possibility of communicating it to a guiltless people, he never suffered the women to come on board. M. de Surville, a French navigator, sailed from Pondichery in the St. Jean Baptiste, passed through the Straits of Malacca, touched at the Bashee Isles, went round Manila, saw land to the S. E. of New Britain, about the latitude of 10.75° S., and longitude 158° E.ast, which he called Port Surville; touched at New Zeeland, and proceeded to Callao, in South America in order to trade there; but being drowned in the landing, and all his letter of recommendation being lost with him, the ship was detained near two years, and then sent to France, with all her merchandize. M. de Surville lay in Doubtless Bay, on the 9th of December, 1769, and saw the Endeavour standing past him, though captain Cook could not see his vessel, which lay under the land. What stay M. de Surville made there, and upon what terms he was with the natives, I know not; but the distance between this place and Queen Charlotte's Sound, and the want of intercourse between the inhabitants of both ports, make it improbable, even supposing the complaint to have existed among his crew, that it could have reached so far south.</description>

<description>[Saturday 17.]July 17th having past the longitude of 227° E.ast, and being in about 40° S.outh latitude, we began to run due north, after a very tedious course in search of the southern continent, the existence of which, in the latitudes we had now passed through, had been positively asserted. The uncomfortable season of the year, the many contrary winds, and the total want of interesting incidents united to make this run extremely tedious to us all, and the only point we had gained by it, was the certainty that no great land was situated in the South Sea about the middle latitudes. In five days time our latitude being 31° south, we began to lose sight of albatrosses and petrels, and the thermometer was risen to 61 1/2, so that we began to change our winter clothes for others, considerably thinner, for the first time after leaving the Cape of Good Hope. The spirits of all our people were much exhilarated in proportion as we approached to the tropics, and our sailors diverted themselves with a variety of plays every evening. The genial mildness of the air was so welcome to us, after a long absence from it, that we could not help preferring the warm climates as the best adapted for the abode of mankind. [Sunday 25.]We saw a tropic bird on the 25th in the afternoon, a sure sign that we were arrived into the temperate climates below 30° of latitude. The setting sun illumined the clouds with the most brilliant tints of gold, which confirmed us in the opinion that the colours of the sky are no where so rich and beautiful as between or near the tropics.</description>

<description>On the 11th, in the morning, we discovered a low island to the southward of us, which seemed about four miles long, and about six miles distant. It appeared to be almost level with the sea, only some groups of trees rose above the horizon, and among them a few cocoa-nut palms out-topped the rest. To people in our situation, exhausted with a tedious passage, the bare sight of land was sufficient to give some consolation, though we could not expect to reap any benefit from its productions; and therefore this island, though divested of every thing strikingly beautiful, yet pleased the eye by the simplicity of its form. Our thermometer was now constantly between 70 and 80 degrees in the morning; but the heat was far from being troublesome, as the fair weather was accompanied by a strong pleasant trade-wind, and our awnings were spread over the quarter-deck. This island, which was called Resolution Island, seems to have been seen by M. de Bougainville. Its latitude is 17° 24' S.outh, and its longitude 141° 39' W.est from Greenwich. Our observation at noon was 17° 17' south, our course being nearly east. In the evening, at half past six o'clock, we saw another island of the same nature as the preceding, about four leagues distant, which was named Doubtful Island. It being after sun-set, we stood to the northward till we had passed by it. [Thursday 12.]The next morning, before day-break, we were alarmed by the sudden appearance of breakers within half a mile a-head of us. We changed our course instantly, apprized our consort of the danger by proper signals, and then stood along the reef. As soon as it was light we distinguished an island of a circular form, including a large bason or lagoon of sea-water; the northern shores were covered with trees and palms in various clusters, which had a very elegant appearance; but all the rest was a narrow ledge of rocks, over which the surf beat with great violence; within it the lagoon was shallow near us, but deeper under the wooded part; a difference which could easily be distinguished by the whiter or the bluer colour of the water. Captain Cook gave this isle the name of Furneaux Island; it is situated in 17° 5' S.outh latitude, and 143° 16' W.est longitude. Standing along this reef we saw a canoe sailing near the northern part of the isle, and by the help of glasses we observed six or seven men in it, one of which was placed at the stern steering with a paddle. They did not seem to have embarked in order to reconnoitre us, as they did not approach the southern reef, but kept close in with the wooded part of the island. We proceeded all day with a favourable breeze and fair weather till sun-set; but the navigation between these low islands and reefs being extremely dangerous, because they can only been seen at short distances, we were obliged to bring to at night in order to avoid meeting with them unawares. [Friday 13.] Early the next morning we left another island of this kind on our starboard quarter, which was called Adventure Island; it lies in 17° 4' S.outh latitude, and 144° 30' W.est longitude. We spoke with the Adventure about the same time, and were told she had above thirty men on the sick list, most of them ill of the scurvy. Our sloop still kept rather free of this distemper, and every precaution was taken to preserve our crew in health by a plentiful use of sour-krout, by airing the hammocks every day, and frequently smoaking the ship with gunpowder and vinegar.</description>

<description>[1773. november.][Saturday 27.]THE morning after we had taken our departure, we had a N. N. W. wind, which raised the thermometer to 64 deg. The two next days it stood at 54 deg. then at 48; and when we were in about 49° of south latitude, at 44 1/2 deg. On the 28th of November, we observed a number of seals, or perhaps sea-lions, passing by us at a distance towards the land which we had left. From that time [1773. December][Monday 6.]to the 6th of December we daily saw great flocks of blue and other petrels, together with the different species of albatrosses, the skuas or grey gulls, many pinguins, and abundance of sea-weed. About seven in the evening, on that day, we were in the latitude of 51° 33' S.outh, and long. 180° W.; consequently just at the point of the antipodes of London. The remembrance of domestic felicity, and of the sweets of society, called forth a sigh from every heart which felt the tender ties of filial or parental affection. We are the first Europeans, and I believe I may add, the first human beings, who have reached this point, where it is probable none will come after us. A common report prevails indeed in England concerning Sir Francis Drake, who is said to have visited the antipodes, which the legend expresses by " his having passed under the middle arch of London-bridge:" but this is a mistake, as his track lay along the coast of America, and probably originates from his having passed the periœci, or the point in 180° long. on the same circle of north latitude, on the coast of California.</description>

<description>We now entertained hopes of penetrating to the south as far as other navigators have done towards the north pole; but on the 30th, about seven o'clock in the morning, we discovered a solid ice-field of immense extent before us, which bore from E. to W. A bed of fragments floated all round this field, which seemed to be raised several feet high above the level of the water. A vast number of icy masses, some of a very great height, were irregularly piled up upon it, as far as the eye could reach. Our latitude was at this time 71° 10' S.outh, consequently less than 19 deg. from the pole; but as it was impossible to proceed farther, we put the ship about, well satisfied with our perilous expedition, and almost persuaded that no navigator will care to come after, and much less attempt to pass beyond us. Our longitude at this time was nearly 106° W. The thermometer here was at 32°, and a great many pinguins were heard croaking round us, but could not be seen on account of the foggy weather which immediately succeeded.</description>

<description>During this time we advanced to the northward very [Tuesday 22.]fast, so that on the 22d we reached 36° 10' S. latitude, where the albatrosses left us. Our longitude being about 94.5° W.est from Greenwich, we steered to the south-westward, in quest of a supposed discovery of Juan Fernandez, which, according to Juan Luis Arias, a Spanish author, is said to lie in 40° S.outh latitude, and by Mr. Dalrymple's chart in 90° W.est from London See Mr. Dalryple's Historical Collection, vol. I. p. 53, and the Chart. . We stood [Friday 25.]on to the westward till the 25th at noon, where being in 37° 50' S. and about 101° W. and seeing no signs of land, we altered our course something to the northward. The dangerous situation of captain Cook, was perhaps the reason, why our track was not continued farther to the south, so as to put this matter entirely out of doubt for the future. It was indeed of the utmost importance at present, to hasten to a place of refreshment, that being the only chance to preserve his life.</description>

<description>The natives about us were a well-made, handsome people, of a good yellowish or tawny colour, but looked almost black, by being punctured over the whole body. They were all naked, having only a small piece of cloth, perfectly resembling that made by the people of Taheitee, round their waist and loins. Their beards and hair were of a fine jetty black, and their language much nearer the Taheitian, than any other dialect in the South Sea, with this difference, that they could not pronounce the r. Their canoes were thin, and formed of boards slightly sewed together, and their paddles were made like those of Taheitee, with a knob at the end. We continually enquired for hogs, and told them to bring us some; and towards night we had the satisfaction to see a pig along-side, which we purchased for a knife. As soon as it was dark, the canoes retired, according to the general custom of all the nations in the South Sea we had hitherto seen, on whom the novelty of an European ship cannot prevail to wake a single night. The vallies in our harbour were very full of trees, and every part answered the graphical description which the Spaniards have given, and by which we were well convinced that their harbour of Madre de Dios was the same where we had anchored See Mr. Dalrymple's Collection, vol. I. p. 66. . Its situation, deduced from astronomical observation, is in 9° 55' S. latitude, and 139° W. longitude. We saw many fires through the trees, at a great distance from the water, and concluded the country to be well inhabited. [Friday 8.]The next morning early we had a full view of the land, clear of the clouds which rested on it in the evening. On the south side rises a peak, which is very craggy and inaccessible. All the north side is a black, burnt hill, of which the rock is vaulted along the sea-shore, and the top clad to the summit with a shrubbery of casuarinas. But the bottom of the harbour is filled up with a very high ridge, level at top, and resembling the Table-mountain at the Cape of Good Hope. Several vallies, perfectly filled with trees, lead up from two beaches to the very summit of the mountain, which appears excessively steep. Along its uppermost edge we saw a row of stakes or pallisadoes, closely connected together, like a fortification, within which, by the help of our glasses, we discerned something like huts. These places we supposed to be what the Spaniards have called intrenchments; but they bore a great resemblance to the hippas of the New Zeelanders, which are commonly situated on high ridges, and surrounded with pallisades.</description>

<description>[Sunday 17.]On the 17th we discovered a low island, about ten o'clock in the morning, and coming up with it about noon, we were convinced, from the perspicuity of Mr. Byron's description, that it was the eastermost of King George's Islands. We were also confirmed in this belief towards night, when we perceived the other island, which he comprehended under that name. The island before us was extremely low and sandy, and formed an elliptic rocky ledge, no less than six leagues in its longest diameter, from north to south. Its latitude is 14° 28' S. and its longitude 144° 56' W. From space to space it was covered with coco-nut trees in great numbers, which had a pleasing airy look. Various trees and shrubberies sometimes concealed the stems of these palms to a great part of their height, but their beautiful crown always towered above the rest. The intervals between these green spots were so low, that the sea washed over them into the lagoon within. The stillness of the water, confined by the ledge of rocks, and its milky hue where it was shallow, contrasted very agreeably with the ruffled surface of the berylline unfathomable ocean. We sailed close along the western side of the island in the afternoon, and observed the rocks to be tinged with a fine scarlet colour in many places, exactly as Mr. Byron had found them. Several canoes sailing in the lagoon, smokes rising up between the clumps of trees, and armed men of a dark hue running along shore, were objects which greatly encreased the pleasure of the prospect. We likewise perceived women retiring to a remote part of the ledge, with bundles on their backs; an evident sign that they expected no good from our appearance on their coast. Indeed, having had the misfortune to lose some of their countrymen in opposing Mr. Byron's boats, and having been expelled from their habitation during a whole day by his people, who lived at discretion on their coco-nuts, it is not surprising that they secured their small possessions against the invasion of people who looked so like their enemies. Towards the S. W. end of the island we perceived the passage into the lagoon, which Mr. Byron mentions, and sent a boat to sound in its entrance, because at that time we were not yet acquainted with his ill success in the same attempt. Our people found a bottom of sharp corals, which made it impracticable for the ship to anchor. The natives, who were assembled in arms on the north point of the passage, behaved very quietly, and brought some coco-nuts, which were exchanged for nails. Upon this information, another boat was hoisted out, and both sent to the shore again, in order to trade with the natives, and to efface the sinister ideas which they seemed to have conceived of us at first. My father, Dr. Sparrman, and myself were of the party; though I was extremely ill of a bilious complaint. We landed without any opposition, and immediately mixed among the natives, of whom there seemed to be about fifty or sixty. They were all a set of stout men, of a dark brown, and had some punctures on the breast, belly, and hands, chiefly in imitation of fishes, which furnish a great part of their food. Their features were not disagreeable, but more mild than those of the natives of all the high islands about them. They went perfectly naked, having only a very small piece of cloth about their loins. Their women did not come near us; but those whom we saw at a distance had the same colour as the men, and their piece of cloth was enlarged to the size of a short apron. The hair and beards were generally black and curling, but sometimes cut; however I took notice of a single man, whose hair was quite yellowish at the points. As soon as we landed they embraced us, touching our noses, after the custom of New Zeeland, and began to bring coco-nuts and dogs for sale to the boats. Mahine, who was with us, purchased several dogs for small nails, and some for ripe bananas, which he had brought from the Marquesas. This fruit was much valued by the people of the low island, who immediately knew it; it should seem therefore that they have some acquaintance with the high islands, since bananas never grow upon their barren coral-ledges. The dogs were not unlike those at the Society Islands, but had fine long hair of a white colour. Mahine therefore was eager to purchase them, because that very sort of hair is made use of in his country to adorn the breast-plates of the warriors. We attempted to go directly into the grove, under which the habitations were situated; but the natives opposing it, we advanced along the point, picking various plants, and particularly a scurvy-grass, which was common, and seemed to be very wholesome. The natives shewed us that they bruised this plant, mixed it with shell-fish, and threw it into the sea, wherever they perceive a shoal of fishes. This food intoxicates them for some time, and thus they are caught on the surface, without any other trouble than that of taking them up. The name which they give to this useful plant is e-Now. We likewise met with plenty of purslane, resembling the common sort, which the natives call e-Tooree. This plant likewise grows at the Society Islands, and is there dressed under-ground, and eaten by the people. There were several sorts of trees on this island which grow in the Society Isles, and likewise some plants which we had not seen before. The soil was extremely scanty; the foundation consisted of coral, very little elevated above the surface of the water. On this we found a coarse white sand, mixed with fragments of coral and shells, and a very thin covering of mould. We advanced insensibly round the point, so as to come behind the habitations, and discovered another point jutting out into the lagoon, and forming a kind of bay, of which the shore was perfectly covered with shrubberies and groves. Between the two points the water was very shallow; and we perceived a great body of the natives crossing over from the farthest point, and dragging their spears after them. We immediately retired into the thicket, and passed by the huts, of which all the inhabitants were on the beach. These huts were very small and low, covered with a kind of matting of coco-nut branches. We only saw some dogs in them. Their boat-houses were exactly of the same materials, only a little larger. The canoes in them were very short, but stout, and pointed at both ends, and had sharp keel. As soon as we came on the beach, we mixed among the natives, who were rather surprised to see us come out of their village. We acquainted the lieutenant who commanded our boats with the hostile appearances we had seen, upon which our people were upon their guard, and prepared to reimbark. In the mean time Mahine assisted us in conversing with the natives, who told us that they had a chief or areekee, and that they called their island Teoukea. Their language, upon the whole, approached very much to the Taheitian dialect, except that their pronunciation was more coarse and guttural. The reinforcement now began to appear in the bushes, armed with long clubs, or round short staves, and spears, some fourteen feet, some nine feet long, pointed with the jagged tail of the sting-ray. We therefore stepped into our boats, but the natives crouded about them, and seemed in doubt whether they should detain us or not; however, as our retreat had been too early for their scheme, they appeared contented with our departure, and assisted us in pushing off the boats. Some threw small stones into the water near us, and all seemed to glory in having, as it were, frightened us off. They all talked a great deal, and very loud, after we were gone, and at last seated themselves along the beach, in the shade of the trees. We were no sooner on board, and had recited our adventures, than the captain ordered four or five cannon-shot to be fired over their heads, and into the sea before them, to shew what he could do. These balls, and especially the last, terrified them so much, that they all ran away from this point with the greatest precipitation. The number of coco-nuts which we obtained among them did not amount to more than thirty, and the dogs were about five. Mr. Byron found wells on this island, which, though they afforded but a small quantity of fresh water, may be sufficient to supply the few inhabitants with this necessary element. That navigator likewise met with burying-places of stone, in the grove, which have a very great affinity with the Taheitian maraïs. The offerings of animal and vegetable food, hung on the branches of trees around these cemeteries, strengthen that similarity. There is reason to believe, from this circumstance, as well as from the form, manners, and language of the people, that they are very nearly allied to the happier inhabitants of the mountainous isles in the neighbourhood. The great lagoons within their circular islands are probably plentiful reservoirs of fish, from whence they are supplied with constant food. The sandy barren part of their ledges is a fit place upon which turtles may deposit their eggs; and it appears from the fragments found by the Dolphin's people, that they know how to catch these large creatures, whose nutritive flesh and shell must be a delicious treat to them. The few plants which thrive about them are very useful, and furnish them with the means of facilitating the capture of fish; some trees are so large that their trunks may be used for canoes, and their branches for weapons and tools. The coco-palm, which is the principal support of many nations on the globe, is likewise of infinite service to them, and almost every part of it is useful. The nuts which it bears, whilst they are green, contain from a pint to a quart of limpid liquor, which has a very pleasant sweetness, joined to a peculiar agreeable flavour; its coolness and integrant particles, doubtless, make it a most delicious draught, powerful beyond comparison in quenching thirst in a hot climate. When the nut grows older, the kernel forms, which is at first like a rich cream, and afterwards grows firm and very oily, like an almond, being extremely nutritious. The oil is frequently expressed, and employed to anoint the hair and the whole body, at certain times. The hard shell provides the natives with cups; and the fibrous coating round it affords all kinds of cordage, which are strong, elastic, and not much impaired by constant use. Several articles of Indian houshold furniture, and several sorts of ornaments are made with it. The long feathered leaves or branches, which spread from the top of the stem, are fit coverings for their houses; and when plaited, make good baskets for provisions. The inner bark yields a kind of cloth, sufficient for covering the body in a hot climate; and the stem itself, when grown too old to bear, is at least fit to be used in the construction of a hut, or may make the mast of a canoe. But besides fish and vegetable food, they have also dogs, which live upon fish, and are reckoned excellent meat by the natives of the Society Islands, to whom they are known. Thus Providence, in its wise dispensations, made even these insignificant narrow ledges rich enough in the productions of nature, to supply a whole race of men with the necessaries of life. And here we cannot but express our admiration, that the minutest agents are subservient to the purposes of the Almighty Creator. The coral is known to be the fabrick of a little worm, which enlarges its house, in proportion as its own bulk encreases. This little creature, which has scarce sensation enough to distinguish it from a plant, builds up a rocky structure from the bottom of a sea too deep to be measured by human art, till it reaches the surface, and offers a firm basis for the residence of man! The number of these low islands is very great, and we are far from being acquainted with them all. In the whole extent of the Pacific Ocean, between the tropics, they are to be met with; however, they are remarkably frequent for the space of ten or fifteen degrees to the eastward of the Society Islands. Quiros, Schouten, Roggewein, Byron, Wallis, Carteret, Bougainville, and Cook have each met with new islands in their different courses; and what is most remarkable, they have found them inhabited at the distance of two hundred and forty leagues to the east of Taheitee. Nothing is more probable than that on every new track other islands of this kind will still be met with, and particularly between the 16th and 17th degree of S. latitude, no navigator having hitherto run down on that parallel towards the Society Islands. It remains a subject worthy the investigation of philosophers, to consider from what probable principles these islands are so extremely numerous, and form so great an archipelago to windward of the Society Islands, whilst they are only scattered at considerable distances beyond that group of mountainous islands? It is true, there is another archipelago of coral ledges far to the westward; I mean the Friendly Islands; but these are of a different nature, and appear to be of a much older date; they occupy more space, and have a greater quantity of soil, on which all the vegetable productions of the higher lands may be raised.</description>

<description>[Tuesday 19.]The next morning, at eight o'clock, we decried another island of the same nature, but which we suppose had not been seen before. Towards noon another appeared to the westward, which we coasted all the afternoon. It was about eight leagues long, and full of people, who ran along the shore with very long spears in their hands. The lagoon within was very spacious, and several canoes sailed about upon it. It appears to me, that the most elevated and richest spots on the coral-ledges, are generally to leeward, sheltered from the violence of the surf. In this sea, however, there are seldom such violent storms, as might make these isles uncomfortable places of abode; and when the weather is fair, it must be very pleasant sailing on the smooth water in the lagoon, whilst the ocean without is disagreeably agitated. A third new island was seen in the evening, which we left the next morning, after we had lain to all night. This group captain Cook called Palliser's Islands; they are situated in about 15° 36' S. latitude, and 146° 30' W.longitude. The northernmost of these islands seem to be the Pernicious Islands on which Roggewein lost the African galley. As Mr. Byron found a boat's rudder on Teoukea, which is at a short distance from these isles, that circumstance serves to confirm my supposition See Hawkesworth, vol. I. p. 102. .</description>

<description>We passed the island of Mowrua in the afternoon, and stood to the westward with a favourable trade-wind. On the 6th, at eleven in the morning, we descried an island, which captain Wallis named after lord Howe. It is very low, consisting of coral ledges, which enclose a lagoon; and by its direction, it appears to be the same which the natives of the Society Islands call Mopeehàh. We found it situated in 16° 46' S. lat. and 154° 8' W. Several birds, called boobies,3 were seen in the neighbourhood of this little isle, which was to appearance uninhabited.</description>

<description>[Thursday 16.]On the 16th, in the morning, at eight o'clock, we discovered another low island. We were close to it about three in the afternoon, and sailed round it, without finding a landing place or harbour. It consisted of eight different isles, connected by reefs, and covered with trees, particularly coco-palms, which made it look remarkably pleasant. Vast flocks of aquatic birds appeared about it, from whence we concluded, that it was likewise uninhabited. In some parts there were extensive sandy beaches, where turtles probably resort to lay their eggs. The sea was also full of good fish, of different sorts, about us. This pretty little spot was named Palmerston Island, and lies in 18° 4' S. lat. and 163° 10' W.</description>

<description>[Monday 20.]We continued steering to the W. S. W. till the 20th, when we saw an island in the afternoon,4 of some elevation, on which, before sunset, we could discern the trees. We tacked all night to windward, and at the return of daylight stood towards it. Having approached within about two miles, we ran along the shore, which now appeared steep and rocky, with here and there a narrow sandy beach at the foot of the rock. It was nearly level every where, and its greatest height seemed not to exceed forty feet; but it was covered with woods and shrubberies along the summit. About ten o'clock, we perceived seven or eight people running close to the water's edge. They seemed to be of a blackish colour, and were naked; something white was wrapped about their heads and loins, and each had a spear, a club, or a paddle in his hand. In several chasms between the rocks, we observed a few small canoes hauled upon the shore. We now likewise took notice of some coco-nut trees, of no great height, which stood on the slope of the rocks. Two boats were hoisted out, armed and manned, in which the captain, accompanied by Dr. Sparrman, Mr. Hodges, my father, and myself, went ashore. A reef of coral surrounds the whole coast at a short distance; but having found an opening, where the surf was not dangerous, we landed, and climbed up one of the adjacent rocks, where we posted some of our sailors and marines. It consisted entirely of sharp and craggy coral, and was covered with a variety of small shrubby plants, common to the low islands. Besides these, we found some new species, all which grew between the crevices of the coral, without the least atom of soil. Some curlews, snipes, and herons, of the same sort which we had observed at Taheitee, likewise appeared on this island. Having walked among the bushes, at the distance of about fifty yards from the water, we heard a loud halloo, upon which we retired to the rock, where our people had taken post. We now learnt that captain Cook, having walked up a long deep gulley, which lay before us, had entered the woods at a little distance from us. He had not proceeded far, when he heard somebody tumbling down from a tree. He supposed it was one of us, and called out to us, but was presently undeceived by the shouts of the Indian. We now called to the natives in those South Sea dialects which we were acquainted with, that we were friends, and desired them to come down to us. They were heard talking and shouting to each other for some time; and presently one of them appeared at the entrance of the gulley. His body was blackened as far as the waist; his head was ornamented with feathers placed upright, and in his hand he held a spear. Behind him we heard many voices in the chasm, though the trees prevented our seeing the people. At last a young man, to all appearance without a beard, stepped forward, and joined the first. He was like him blackened, and had a long bow, like those of Tonga-Tabboo, in his right hand. With the left he instantly flung a very large stone, with so much accuracy, as to hit Dr. Sparrman's arm a violent blow, at the distance of forty yards. The pain which it occasioned irritated my friend so much, that he let fly at his enemy; but it did not appear that the small shot had any effect. Both the natives retired soon after; and though we staid here for some time, performing the idle ceremony of taking possession, we saw nothing more of the inhabitants. After we had resumed our course along shore in the boats, we saw the people coming to the water's side at the place which we had left. The appearance of the coast was still the same as we advanced. We landed at the hazard of our necks in another place, which we left as soon as the boat's crew called out, that they perceived the natives above us. We continued till we came to a considerable chasm in the rock, before which a flat reef, full of holes and cavities, extended about fifty yards off shore. We drew up a line of sailors on the reef, and the captain with us walked into the chasm, where we found four canoes. They were very nearly of the same structure with those of Tonga-Tabboo, and had some carving, but were not so neatly wrought. They were single, and had strong out-riggers. Some were covered with coarse mats, and contained fishing-lines, spears, and pieces of wood, which appeared to have served as matches for fishing at night. The captain laid a small present of beads, nails, and medals on each canoe; but whilst he was so employed, I perceived a troop of natives coming down the chasm, and instantly acquainting our company of it, we all retired a few steps. Two of the natives, dressed with feathers, and blackened as the other before mentioned, advanced towards us with furious shouts, and spears in their hands. We called in friendly terms to them; but to no purpose. The captain endeavoured to discharge his musket, but it missed fire. He desired us to fire in our own defence, and the same thing happened to us all. The natives threw two spears: captain Cook narrowly escaped one of them by stooping; the other slid along my thigh, marking my cloaths with the black colour with which it was daubed. We tried to fire again, and at last my piece, loaded with small shot, went off, and Mr. Hodges fired a ball, which did no execution. At the same time a regular firing began behind us from our party, who having observed our retreat, had likewise viewed another troop of the natives coming down by a different path to cut us off. The effect of the small shot fortunately stopped the natives from rushing upon us, and gave us time to retreat to our men, who continued to fire with great eagerness, while any of the natives remained in sight. Two of these in particular, standing among the bushes, brandished their weapons in defiance a considerable while, but at last retired, one of them appearing to be wounded, by the dismal howl which we heard presently after. We now embarked, and resolved to abandon a set of people, whom no entreaties could prevail upon to become our friends. The nature of their country, which is almost inaccessible, seems to have contributed to make their tempers so unsociable. The whole island is purely a coral-rock, like that of the low islands, on which we saw very few coco-palms, and no useful trees. I have therefore formed a conjecture, that the interior parts are not so barren, but fit for the culture of nutritive vegetables. The general resemblance of this island to a coral ledge raised out of the water, almost leads me to suspect that it includes a fertile plain, which was once a lagoon.5 Whether a convulsion of the globe, or any other cause, lifted such a large piece of coral-rock forty feet above water, is a point which must be left to future philosophers to determine. The boats and arms of the natives resembled those of Tonga-Tabboo, and it is therefore probable that the people have the same origin; but their numbers are inconsiderable, and their civilization little advanced, since they are savage, and go naked. Their island seems to be about three leagues long, and was called Savage Island. It is situated in 19° 1' S. and 169° 37' W.</description>

<description>The island of Namoka, which we left after a stay of two days only, was not above fifteen miles in circuit, but seemed to be remarkably populous. It lies in 20° 17' S.14 and 174° 32' W. In the group of islands which appeared around it, its size was the most considerable; but all seemed to be well inhabited, and very rich in vegetable productions. They are situated on a kind of bank, on which there is from nine to sixty and seventy fathom water, and the soil is probably the same in every island. Namoka consists, like Tonga-Tabboo, of a coral-rock, covered with a rich mould on which all sorts of vegetables thrive. We had no time to examine the hillock in its centre, which seems to have had a different origin, and may perhaps be volcanic. At present it is wholly covered with the richest groves, like the rest of the island. The abundance of fresh water in the pond, is an advantage which the people of Namoka enjoy in preference to those of Tonga-Tabboo; but it does not appear that they bathe so regularly as the Taheitians, perhaps because the stagnant water is not very inviting. Its advantage is however so much felt, that the natives brought it to the ship in calabashes, and did the same to Tasman, which implies that it is looked upon as a valuable article among them. The abundance of water, and the richness of the soil likewise seems to be the reason, that bread-fruit and shaddock trees are much more frequent, and all vegetation infinitely more luxuriant than on Tonga-Tabboo. The fences on that account are not laid out, and kept up with that extreme regularity, though they are still preserved in part. The long walks of fruit-trees, and the delightful green turf under them, were rather to be compared to the richest spots on Ea-oowhe, or Middleburg Island. The tufted arbours which vaulted over the paths, are hung with beautiful flowers of all kinds, many of which filled the air with fragrance. The variety of scenes formed by many little risings, and different groups of houses and trees, together with the lagoons, conspire to adorn this island. The fowls and hogs which we saw in the neighbourhood of every dwelling, the prodigious number of shaddocks which lay under every tree, hardly noticed by the natives, and the quantities of yams which filled their houses, gave a picture of abundance and affluence which delighted the eye and comforted the heart. At sight of a plenteous prospect, human nature feels an instinctive satisfaction, and good humour and joy are soon revived in the most dejected breast. Amidst the dismal scenes of our voyage, these intervening moments are remarkably contrasted, and therefore had a great effect upon us. It is so natural to dwell upon pleasing subjects, that I hope, I need not apologize for my frequent descriptions; and I must refer the reader to Mr. Hodges's view in the interior parts of Namoka</description>

<description>A few miles to the westward of the island we found a great circular reef of coral, including a lagoon. It was suspected that this lagoon might be the abode of turtles, and two boats were hoisted out in the afternoon to go in quest of them. The fishery proved very unsuccessful, not a single turtle being seen, and the crew hoisted the boats in again before sunset. We then left this new discovery, which was named Turtle Island, and is situated in 19° 48' S. and 178° 2' W.21</description>

<description>[Saturday 9.]On the 9th of July, having reached nearly 176° E. and being in 20° S. we changed our course to the N. W. Our fresh gale continued without any change till the 13th, [Wednesd. 13.]when it was somewhat abated, and a few drops of rain fell both at night and in the morning. The second anniversary of our departure from England, which happened on this day, was celebrated by the sailors with their usual mirth. They drank plentifully, having saved a part of their daily allowance, for this solemn occasion, and drowned every gloomy idea in grog, the mariner's Lethe. One of them, of a fanatical22 turn, composed a hymn on the occasion, as he had done the first year; and after seriously exhorting his fellows to repentance, sat down and hugged the bottle heartily; but like all the rest, he proved unequal to the conflict, and sunk under the powerful influence of his adversary.</description>

<description>We now approached the isle of Aurora, where we observed a fine beach, and the most luxuriant vegetation that can be conceived. The whole country was woody; numberless climbers ran up the highest trees, and forming garlands and festoons between them, embellished the scene. A neat plantation fenced with reeds, stood on the slope of the hill, and a beautiful cascade poured down through the adjacent forest.7 About two o'clock three canoes came off from the island of Aurora, when we were close in shore, but as we could not stay for them, they returned like those of Lepers Island. The island of Aurora is about twelve leagues long, but not above five miles broad in any part, lying nearly north and south. The middle is in 15° 6' S. and 168° 24' E. Its mountain or ridge is sharp, and of considerable height. Whitsun Island, which lies about four miles to the south of it, runs in the same direction, and is of the same length, but appears to be somewhat broader at its northern extremity.

<description>We now approached the isle of Aurora, where we observed a fine beach, and the most luxuriant vegetation that can be conceived. The whole country was woody; numberless climbers ran up the highest trees, and forming garlands and festoons between them, embellished the scene. A neat plantation fenced with reeds, stood on the slope of the hill, and a beautiful cascade poured down through the adjacent forest.7 About two o'clock three canoes came off from the island of Aurora, when we were close in shore, but as we could not stay for them, they returned like those of Lepers Island. The island of Aurora is about twelve leagues long, but not above five miles broad in any part, lying nearly north and south. The middle is in 15° 6' S. and 168° 24' E. Its mountain or ridge is sharp, and of considerable height. Whitsun Island, which lies about four miles to the south of it, runs in the same direction, and is of the same length, but appears to be somewhat broader at its northern extremity.

<description>[Thursday 21.]The next morning we had moderate and fair weather, and saw M. de Bougainville's southern island very distinctly. There was a passage between it and the south end of Whitsun Island, about six miles in breadth. A long low point extended from this southern island to the eastward; and all its north side, though steep towards the sea, rose from thence with a gentle and gradual ascent to the highest mountains in the centre. In the mountains, which were still covered with clouds, we observed some volumes, as it appeared, of smoke, which indicated a volcano. This island is about seven leagues in length, and its middle lies in 16° 15' S. and 168° 20' E.</description>

<description>The next morning we weighed the anchor and set sail, having scarcely had time sufficient to sketch a plan of the harbour, which was honoured with the title of Port Sandwich. Its situation, deduced from astronomical observations, is in 16° 28' S.outh lat. and 167° 56' E.ast long. We were becalmed before we could clear the reefs, and obliged to send out boats ahead to tow us out, which they performed very slowly and with great difficulty. In the mean time the natives came to us with all their fourteen canoes, and sold us great numbers of arrows of all kinds and some clubs. They made several trips between the ship and the shore, as they had done the preceding day, and seemed to be very eager to part with their arms for Taheitee cloth. We repeated our demand for provisions; but they would not listen to it, and only parted with what they could more easily spare or replace.43 Towards noon we got clear of the harbour, and left Mallicollo with the sea-breeze, which then freshened, standing over to Ambrrym, or the Island of Volcanoes. Whether we might have obtained some refreshments by staying a few days longer and improving our acquaintance with the natives, is very uncertain; for since they set no value on our iron-ware, we could offer no equivalent for their provisions.</description>

<description>Having cleared the reefs of Port Sandwich, and standing towards the Isle of Ambrrym, we gradually came in sight of the south-east extremity of Mallicollo, where four or five small islands form a kind of bay. Ambrrym, on which the volcano is situated, appears to be upwards of twenty leagues in circuit. The centre of the island lies in 16° 15' S. and 168° 20' E.Pa-oom, the high peak to the south of it, is of an inconsiderable size, but we were dubious whether the land which we saw before, or to the westward of it, and which was of moderate height, is connected with it or not. The whole circuit of both parts, supposing them to form a single island, cannot exceed five leagues. The peak, according to our observations, lies in 16° 25' S. and 168° 30' E.Apee, the island to the south of this peak, is large, hilly, and of the same extent as Ambrrym, being nearly seven leagues long. Its middle is situated in 16° 42' S. and 168° 36' E. The numerous smokes which arose from all these islands, gave us reason to suppose, that the natives dress their victuals above ground, by an open fire. At the Society and Friendly Isles, where the inhabitants are accustomed to stew their food, by means of heated stones under the ground, we rarely perceived either smoke or fire.</description>

<description>We still continued in sight of Mallicollo, Ambrrym, Apee,and Pa-oom, [Sunday 24.]the next morning; but stood towards the southernmost island then in sight, and discovered on the 21st, which from the three hills upon it, was named Three-Hills Island (see p. 204). We approached within half a mile of it, and observed it to be of the same nature with those already discovered. It was well wooded, and probably well inhabited; for some of the natives appeared on the shore, who resembled those of Mallicollo, and were armed like them with bows and arrows. A very extensive reef runs out from the south point58 of the island, with some rocks in it. The whole island seemed to be about five leagues in circuit; its greatest extent was from north-east to south-west; and according to astronomical observations, it is situated in 17° 4' S. latitude, and 168° 32' E. longitude. At noon we put about, and stood for several small islands and broken lands, which appeared off the S. E. end of the island of Apee, and now lay to the N. E. of us. We likewise had sight of a peak to the S.E. and of some land beyond that, which seemed very large, though at a great distance. The number of islands in this group was very surprising; and their direction to the southward, gave us great hopes of continuing to make discoveries, which might gradually lead us back once more to New Zeeland.</description>

<description>[Tuesday 26.]The next morning a gentle breeze sprung up, with which we advanced towards the land again. We now ran within the eastermost island, which, though it was not above eight or nine miles in circuit, was however inhabited, many of the people running along shore to gaze at us, with bows, arrows, and darts in their hands. This isle had a hill of moderate height in its centre, which appeared to be destitute of woods in most parts, the cultivated lands and groves lying at its foot and on its first slope. They consisted of coco-palms, bananas, and various other trees; amongst which we discerned a number of small huts, and on the beach, several canoes hauled ashore. The land opposite to the west was about four or five leagues distant from it, and now likewise appeared to consist of two islands. One of these to the north, the same on which we were near being lost, was small, not above twelve or fifteen miles in circumference, but of moderate height, like the former, and with much the same aspect. To the south of it, the main island appeared, which extended no less than ten leagues from N. W. to S. E. It was of a moderate height, like the two others near it, but very gently sloping in all parts, and presented to the eye many beautiful prospects. Thick groves, and extensive tracts of clear ground, were very agreeably varied, and the latter had a rich yellowish colour, which exactly resembled the golden corn-fields of Europe. We all agreed that this island was one of the finest we had hitherto seen in the new group, and seemed to be well situated for the purpose of an European settlement.61 We kept at a considerable distance from it; but it appeared to us to be more thinly inhabited than those which we had left to the northward. This circumstance would facilitate the establishment of a colony; and if the spirit of philanthropy could ever animate the planters, they would here have an opportunity to become the benefactors of the natives. From what we observed at Mallicollo, this race of men is very intelligent, and would readily receive the improvements of civilization. There appeared to be a bay towards the N. W. end of the island, which we did not examine, on account of several small islands and reefs lying before it to the eastward. It appeared to form a deep indenture on the shore, and to be more accessible from the westward. Captain Cook named this extensive island Sandwich, that to the north Hinchinbrook, and the other to the east Montagu. The middle of Sandwich Island lies in 17° 40' S. lat. and 168° 30' E. long.</description>

<description>After breakfast we weighed the anchor, and prepared to stand farther into the bay, our boats having found convenient anchorage nearer to the watering-place. All the western coast of the bay was covered with thousands of palms, which had a beautiful effect, and appeared to be different from the coco-palm. We soon came in sight of the place where the engagement had happened. A few natives who stood here and there on the shore, ran into the woods on seeing the ship. We saw the two oars which they had taken out of the boat stuck in the ground and leaning on the bushes; but it was not thought proper to send a boat in quest of them, though the coast was clear. After we had entertained hopes of coming to an anchor again for some time, the captain gave orders to put about, and stood to the eastward round the saddle-peak, which was now called Traitor's Head.71 We tacked all the morning, in order to weather that point, but could not accomplish it till three o'clock in the afternoon, when we opened a bay immediately to the eastward of it. This bay extended very far inland, and seemed to contain several snug creeks or harbours. The lands on both sides were covered with the thickest woods, which had a most fertile and enchanting appearance. To the south, the land sloped very gently, offering a fine exposure of vast extent almost wholly cultivated, and in all likelihood rich in vegetable productions. We were just abreast of this bay, and perhaps in doubt whether we should not go in, when the island appeared in sight again to the south, which we had already discovered on the 28th of July. Captain Cook now resolved to relinquish the nearer island, and to proceed to the more distant one, in order to leave as little unexplored as possible. The breeze was very fresh, and we left the island with great rapidity. It is situated in 18° 48' S.outh latitude, and 169° 20' E.ast longitude We have given it the name of Irromanga, for, as we afterwards learnt on an adjacent island, this is the name by which it is known among the natives. See the next chapter.72 , and is nearly of a square figure, which measures at least 30 leagues in circuit. We stood southerly towards the new island, with studding sails set, which had been in disuse with us ever since we arrived among this group of isles. Several fires appeared upon the island at night, one of which blazed up from time to time like the flame of a volcano.</description>

<description>The wind being favourable to our departure at present, we weighed the anchor, and set sail, after a stay of sixteen days. The island of Tanna is situated in 19° 30' S. lat. and 169° 38' E. long. and I believe does not exceed twenty-four leagues in circuit. A clayey sort of stone, mixed with pieces of chalk-stones, forms most of the rocks which we examined. It is commonly of a brownish or yellowish colour, and lies in strata nearly horizontal, about six inches thick. In a few places we observed a soft black stone, composed of the ashes and sherls thrown up by the volcano, mixed with clay, or with a sort of tripoly, which is called rotten-stone by some miners. This substance sometimes forms alternate strata with the black stone. The same volcanic sand, mixed with vegetable mold, forms the rich soil of this island, on which, as I have already mentioned, all vegetables thrive with uncommon luxuriance. The volcano which burns on the island, doubtless works a great change in its mineral productions, and might perhaps have afforded some new observations, if the jealousy of the natives had not continually prevented our examining it. We found native sulphur in the white earth which covers the solfataras, from whence the aqueous streams arise. The taste of this earth was strongly aluminous, and it may perhaps be impregnated with particles of that salt. We likewise met with a red bolus near these places, and observed a white selenitic stone among the natives, which they wear as an ornament in the cartilage between the nostrils. We found some specimens of strong lavas; but as we could not come near the volcano, we never met with them in any quantity. The hot springs have a kind of astringency in the taste, which gives us some reason to suspect that they contain mineral particles; but we had no opportunity to make experiments on board with the water which we brought from thence. The only remark of any consequence, is a confirmation of a former well-known fact with regard to volcanos, viz. that these burning mountains are not always the highest in the whole ridge, as in Peru and Sicily, but that they sometimes break out in a secondary ridge, and are even of an inconsiderable height. As there are instances in the Açores, and in the Archipelago, that volcanic eruptions have forced their way through the sea from the unfathomable bottom, this circumstance would be of less consequence, if it had not disagreed with the opinion of the great naturalist, M. de Buffon.68 He asserts, that the highest mountains alone are the seat of volcanic fires, being desirous to remove these fires as far from the centre of the earth as possible. Another observation which we made seems to prove, that the eruptions commonly succeeded after showers of rain; but so short a stay as ours is insufficient to give this remark its necessary weight, though it coincides with the conjectures which have hitherto been made concerning the causes of subterraneous fires. The vegetable productions of Tanna are very rich and various. The forests are filled with plants, of which a great number were new to us, and some were species hitherto known only in the East Indian islands. The cultivated grounds likewise contain a great variety of plants which are unknown in the Society and Friendly Islands, and no less than forty different species are cultivated. Among the spontaneous plants, we ought particularly to repeat the mention of the nutmeg, in defence of Quiros's veracity, who asserts that he found it in Tierra del Espiritù Santo, which doubtless belongs to this group of islands. Whether oranges are cultivated, or grow wild, is uncertain, as we never met with a single tree that bore them, but were obliged to content ourselves with the fruit, which the women sometimes sold to us.</description>

<description>[Sunday 21.]In the evening we came near the island of Irronan, which was found to lie about twelve leagues to the east of Tanna, and consisted of a high table-hill. We passed the night in tacking, and the next morning ascertained the situation of Anattom in 20° 3' S.outh, and 170° 5' E.ast. Its size was inferior to that of Tanna, though we kept at such a distance that we could not determine it with precision; but the height of its mountains was to all appearance nearly the same. Observing no other islands to the southward at present, we shaped our course along the south-west shore of Tanna, which we saw to great advantage on that side, all the hills sloping very gently from their summits and inland ridges. [Monday 22.]As the wind was very fresh and wholly in our favour, we were on the lee-side of Irromanga the next morning. Captain Cook was resolved to spend some time in examining the western coasts of all this group of islands, and particulary not to leave unexplored that to the north of Mallicollo, which had been seen by M. de Bougainville. This group being the westernmost hitherto known in the South Pacific Ocean, captain Cook named the New Hebrides The Hebrides are the westermost islands of Great Britain. , having acquired the right of giving this new collective name by discovering ten large islands, besides a number of smaller ones, all which had never been seen before. The day was not yet spent when we had already passed the southern shores of Sandwich Island. Its aspect on that side was very beautiful, and its forests seemed more rich and copious than we had formerly observed them to the northward. Four small islands, of inconsiderable height but finely wooded with the most tufted trees, formed a harbour, which had the appearance of being very convenient and safe.</description>

<description>A great number of natives were observed on the shore, and two canoes put off about noon, paddling towards us, but soon giving over the chace, as we sailed on too fast for them. Beyond the point which included the bay to the north-west, the country lost something of its exuberant fertility, and was interspersed with barren spots, though we saw smokes and habitations on the highest ridges: and at night the mountains were illuminated in different places, by several lines of fires, some of which appeared to extend at least half a mile in length. We passed the north point of Mallicollo during night, and were a good way advanced in Bougainville's passage at day-break on the 24th. [Wednesd. 24.]Mallicollo lies nearly N. N. W. and S. S. E. and the north point is in 15° 50' S. and 167° 23' E. The land which forms the north side of the passage, appeared very extensive, high and mountainous, and a number of small islands lay along its southern coast, which were of a very moderate height, and covered with the finest forests. The continual fair weather which attended this part of our nagivation, made all these beautiful landscapes appear to the greatest advantage; and the pleasure of contemplating a great variety of rich sceneries, made us some amends for the wretchedness of our diet, which at present consisted of no other than the ship's provisions. </description>

<description>We were now entertained once more with the sight of the island of Lepers, and Aurora which remained at a great distance to the east of us. Our course continued to the north along the eastern shore of Tierra del Espiritu Santo, where we still discovered new islands, which were not seen by M. de Bougainville. These small islands, as well as the main land, had all a very fertile aspect, being covered with fine forests, from whence numerous smokes ascended, which were so many signs of a great population. Having passed the night, standing off and on, we came abreast of the northernmost islands the next morning, [Thursday 25.]and took notice that even the large land extended no further northward. Most of the small islands were very long, narrow, and bluff at one end, but formed a low flat point, running out to the northward. Their bluff part was commonly white like a chalk-cliff, and it was remarkable that we did not observe any coco-nut trees among their forests, which in some places consisted chiefly of club-wood. As we passed by their northern extremity, they formed a very beautiful prospect, gradually opening from each other, and clear of the main land. Steering to the westward, we passed a projecting point on Tierra del Espiritù Santo, and opened a most spacious bay of which the entrance could be no less than five leagues wide. The depth of the bay was proportioned to the width. The shores on each side seemed to run parallel for the space of seven leagues, at the end of which the bay terminates. A fine beach was seen all along the bottom of it, and the land from thence, for many leagues within the country, consisted of hills of a very moderate height, and extensive populous vallies, which had the appearance of fertility and plenty. We stood over to its western shore where we saw many natives, especially towards the evening; and likewise took notice of a canoe similar to those which we had observed at Mallicollo; it came off, but the people in it kept it at a distance from the ship, and would not come near, though we gave them ever so many invitations. The hill which formed the western shore was rather steep, but however well inhabited, and covered with woods. A low flat point ran out from it a mile or two into the bay, and formed a kind of cove where we wished to come to an anchor, as we were becalmed, and the night was coming on. We sounded several times, but found no bottom with one hundred and thirty, and one hundred and forty fathom, about a mile from the shore. It was soon perfectly dark, and as we only discerned the land by the lights which glimmered through the woods in different places, our situation was beginning to be alarming, and we thought of hoisting out our boats to tow us off, when a faint breeze assisted us to get into the middle of the bay. Here we [Friday 26.]waited for day-light, and then continued to stand in to the southward with light airs, which vanished towards noon. Two boats were sent after dinner to the beach which runs along the bottom of the bay, in order to reconnoitre whether there was any port, or a river, which we could not discern from on board, being still above a league and a half distant. In the mean while three canoes put off from the shore, with triangular sails, and approached the ship very fast. In each of them we observed four or five men, to whom we called, as soon as we thought them within hearing. They were naked, and of the same colour as the Mallicollese; but taller, and more stoutly formed; their hair seemed to be woolly, and their beards frizzled. Some of them had a bunch of feathers on the top of the head, and others wore a white shell tied on the fore-head. On their arms they had bracelets of shell-work, exactly resembling those which we had observed at Mallicollo, and round their middle they wore a narrow belt, from whence a long slip of matted-work, five inches broad, descended to the knees before and behind. One of them had a sago-leaf rolled round his head, forming a kind of airy cap. Their canoes were of indifferent workmanship like those of Mallicollo, and had out-riggers. We saw some spears in them, which had two or three prongs, and were doubtless intended as fish-gigs; but, besides these, the people had no arms whatsoever. They came so near as to accept a present of medals, nails, Taheitee cloth, and red baize; and we could observe them seizing upon the nails with peculiar eagerness, which seems to indicate that they were not wholly unacquainted with them: Quiros perhaps might leave some iron-ware on this island, which has thus acquired a high value among the natives. They fastened a branch of the pepper-plant to the same rope by which we had lowered down the nails to them; but it appeared, that besides this emblem of friendship, they had nothing else to give. We spoke a good deal to them, and they answered from time to time, but neither party understood the other. However, I thought of repeating the numerals in the dialect of the Friendly Islands, and had scarcely begun to count, when they immediately interrupted me, and counted very exactly till ten. We now pointed to the shore, and enquired for the name of the island. They repeated the word Fannoòa, which in the dialect just mentioned signifies land; and called the level district, at the bottom of the bay, Tallaònee, at the same time giving several names for different parts of the country on the sides; but we could not obtain a general name of the island, which we therefore distinguished by that of Tierra del Espiritù Santo, as Quiros had done before. The languages of Mallicollo and Tanna, of which we repeated some words to these people, were either unknown to them, or we pronounced them too improperly to be understood. When they saw our boats coming back from the shore, they left us, it being then near sunset. Lieutenant Pickersgill, who had the command of our boats, reported that he found no soundings before he came within two or three cable's lengths of the shore, but that the bottom was good at this distance. He had found a fine river, which was deep enough for his boat at the entrance, and had landed on one of the banks, whilst a great number of natives appeared in the bushes on the opposite side. He made many signs of friendship, and called and beckoned to them to come over the water; but none of them venturing to accept the invitation, he re-embarked, and returned to the ship. The boats were hoisted in, and a breeze springing up, assisted us to go gradually out of the bay. Captain Cook gave this bay the name of St. Philip and St. Iago; but it is still somewhat doubtful, whether it is the same which Quiros has distinguished by that name; at least the port of Vera Cruz, which according to that Spanish navigator, has room for a thousand ships, is not to be found in it See Mr. Dalrymple's useful and judicious Collection of Voyages, vol. I. p. 132, 142, and 169. . The eastern point of the entrance was named cape Quiros, and lies in 14° 55' S. and 167° 14' E. The western point extends somewhat more to the northward, being in 14° 38' S. and 166° 52' E. and was named cape Cumberland. We were off this point early the next morning, and advanced slowly out of the bay, along the northern coast of the island, being much detained by calms and light airs. Quiros had great reason to extol the beauty and fertility of this country; it is indeed to appearance, one of the finest in the world. Its riches in vegetable productions would doubtless have afforded the botanist an ample harvest of new plants, as next to New Zeeland it was the largest land we had hitherto seen, and had the advantage of having never been examined by other naturalists. But the study of nature was only made the secondary object in this voyage, which, contrary to its original intent, was so contrived in the execution, as to produce little more than a new track on the chart of the southern hemisphere. We were therefore obliged to look upon those moments, as peculiarly fortunate, when the urgent wants of the crew, and the interest of the sciences, happened to coincide.</description>

<description>We were now entertained once more with the sight of the island of Lepers, and Aurora which remained at a great distance to the east of us. Our course continued to the north along the eastern shore of Tierra del Espiritu Santo, where we still discovered new islands, which were not seen by M. de Bougainville. These small islands, as well as the main land, had all a very fertile aspect, being covered with fine forests, from whence numerous smokes ascended, which were so many signs of a great population. Having passed the night, standing off and on, we came abreast of the northernmost islands the next morning, [Thursday 25.]and took notice that even the large land extended no further northward. Most of the small islands were very long, narrow, and bluff at one end, but formed a low flat point, running out to the northward. Their bluff part was commonly white like a chalk-cliff, and it was remarkable that we did not observe any coco-nut trees among their forests, which in some places consisted chiefly of club-wood. As we passed by their northern extremity, they formed a very beautiful prospect, gradually opening from each other, and clear of the main land. Steering to the westward, we passed a projecting point on Tierra del Espiritù Santo, and opened a most spacious bay of which the entrance could be no less than five leagues wide. The depth of the bay was proportioned to the width. The shores on each side seemed to run parallel for the space of seven leagues, at the end of which the bay terminates. A fine beach was seen all along the bottom of it, and the land from thence, for many leagues within the country, consisted of hills of a very moderate height, and extensive populous vallies, which had the appearance of fertility and plenty. We stood over to its western shore where we saw many natives, especially towards the evening; and likewise took notice of a canoe similar to those which we had observed at Mallicollo; it came off, but the people in it kept it at a distance from the ship, and would not come near, though we gave them ever so many invitations. The hill which formed the western shore was rather steep, but however well inhabited, and covered with woods. A low flat point ran out from it a mile or two into the bay, and formed a kind of cove where we wished to come to an anchor, as we were becalmed, and the night was coming on. We sounded several times, but found no bottom with one hundred and thirty, and one hundred and forty fathom, about a mile from the shore. It was soon perfectly dark, and as we only discerned the land by the lights which glimmered through the woods in different places, our situation was beginning to be alarming, and we thought of hoisting out our boats to tow us off, when a faint breeze assisted us to get into the middle of the bay. Here we [Friday 26.]waited for day-light, and then continued to stand in to the southward with light airs, which vanished towards noon. Two boats were sent after dinner to the beach which runs along the bottom of the bay, in order to reconnoitre whether there was any port, or a river, which we could not discern from on board, being still above a league and a half distant. In the mean while three canoes put off from the shore, with triangular sails, and approached the ship very fast. In each of them we observed four or five men, to whom we called, as soon as we thought them within hearing. They were naked, and of the same colour as the Mallicollese; but taller, and more stoutly formed; their hair seemed to be woolly, and their beards frizzled. Some of them had a bunch of feathers on the top of the head, and others wore a white shell tied on the fore-head. On their arms they had bracelets of shell-work, exactly resembling those which we had observed at Mallicollo, and round their middle they wore a narrow belt, from whence a long slip of matted-work, five inches broad, descended to the knees before and behind. One of them had a sago-leaf rolled round his head, forming a kind of airy cap. Their canoes were of indifferent workmanship like those of Mallicollo, and had out-riggers. We saw some spears in them, which had two or three prongs, and were doubtless intended as fish-gigs; but, besides these, the people had no arms whatsoever. They came so near as to accept a present of medals, nails, Taheitee cloth, and red baize; and we could observe them seizing upon the nails with peculiar eagerness, which seems to indicate that they were not wholly unacquainted with them: Quiros perhaps might leave some iron-ware on this island, which has thus acquired a high value among the natives. They fastened a branch of the pepper-plant to the same rope by which we had lowered down the nails to them; but it appeared, that besides this emblem of friendship, they had nothing else to give. We spoke a good deal to them, and they answered from time to time, but neither party understood the other. However, I thought of repeating the numerals in the dialect of the Friendly Islands, and had scarcely begun to count, when they immediately interrupted me, and counted very exactly till ten. We now pointed to the shore, and enquired for the name of the island. They repeated the word Fannoòa, which in the dialect just mentioned signifies land; and called the level district, at the bottom of the bay, Tallaònee, at the same time giving several names for different parts of the country on the sides; but we could not obtain a general name of the island, which we therefore distinguished by that of Tierra del Espiritù Santo, as Quiros had done before. The languages of Mallicollo and Tanna, of which we repeated some words to these people, were either unknown to them, or we pronounced them too improperly to be understood. When they saw our boats coming back from the shore, they left us, it being then near sunset. Lieutenant Pickersgill, who had the command of our boats, reported that he found no soundings before he came within two or three cable's lengths of the shore, but that the bottom was good at this distance.

<description>The day following a light air likewise retarded our progress, so that we slowly examined the western coast of Tierra del Espiritù Santo. A variety of fish were observed swimming along side; two albecores were caught, and a single dolphin was struck with the harpoon, after many unsuccessful attempts. The land on this side was high, and the mountains very steep. Many fires were observed at night, probably in order to clear the ground for plantations. Quiros having likewise seen fires on this island, conjectured as we had done at first, that they were feux de joye, and illuminations, on account of the arrival of ships. A southerly breeze springing up, obliged us to tack off and on, during the 30th and 31st, when we reached the S. W. point of the island, which we named Cape Lisburne, and which is situated in 15° 35' S. and 167° E. We stood once more into the passage between Tierra del Espiritù Santo and Mallicollo, in order to complete the circuit of the former. Here we saw the bay which M. de Bougainville has expressed in his map, sheltered by some of the Bartholomew Islands: it did not however appear to be of such great extent as it is there represented. About six in the evening we put about, and stood to the S. S. W. from the New Hebrides, with a S. E. trade-wind. This group of islands, which we had now cursorily examined in the space of forty-six days, seems to be well worth the attention of future navigators, especially if they should ever be sent out upon the liberal plan of making discoveries in all the various branches of science. I will not pretend to say that they would find great riches of silver and pearls, which Quiros was forced to speak of, in order to engage an interested, avaricious court, to support his great and spirited undertakings. These incitements are not necessary now a-days, when several monarchs in Europe have convinced the world that they can institute voyages of discovery, with no other view than the increase of human knowledge, and the improvement of mankind. The sums which some of their predecessors have lavished on parasites, have been found sufficient to make an immense progress, nay, to produce a new and important revolution in the state of the sciences, which have ever required a trifling expence to triumph over the numberless obstacles that ignorance, envy, or superstitution opposed against them. The natural productions of the New Hebrides, exclusive of all kinds of artificial riches, are therefore in my opinion considerable enough to engage the attention of future voyagers. Their volcanoes, their vegetables, and their inhabitants, would provide sufficient employment for a FerberMr. Ferber is the first and only man of science who has given us a truly scientifical and mineralogical account of Vesuvius, which is worthy the attention of naturalists. See his Letters to baron Born, London, 1776. , a Solander, and many of the historians of mankind.</description>

<description>A calm, which happened after noon, entirely stopped our progress towards the land, to which we were now near enough to discern several smokes, sufficient to prove that it was inhabited. An officer at the mast-head likewise entertained us with the hope of seeing another volcano, of which he said he had seen the smoke bursting out. He must, however, have been deceived by appearances, as we never afterwards saw any volcanic production upon this island. The point which had first been seen, was named after the midshipman, Cape Colnett, and is situated in 20° 30' S.outh, and 165° 2' E.ast. The whole land, appearing to be very extensive, was honoured with the appellation of NovaCaledonia. We could not wait the moment which should make us acquainted with the inhabitants of this land, but formed several conjectures relative to them. As we had found the inhabitants of the New Hebrides not only entirely distinct from the New Zeelanders, but also different amongst themselves, this new country offered itself to our eyes very opportunely in order to account for the population of New Zeeland; but the sequel convinced us that our ideas were very premature on this subject, and that the history of the human species in the South Seas cannot yet be unravelled with any degree of precision.</description>

<description>We walked about till noon, when the boats returned on board with a load of water, having only left a small party with the casks; a precaution, which the honesty of the natives perhaps did not render necessary. Mr. Wales, our astronomer, had in the meanwhile fixed some instruments on the little sandy islet, in order to observe an eclipse of the sun, which happened this day. The captain joined him there, and from this, as well as subsequent observations, they deduced the situation of this little island to be in 20° 15' S. and 164° 40' E.16</description>

<description>We steered between the north and west, along the reefs which enclose New Caledonia, in order to ascertain the position of lands which we had indistinctly seen in that quarter. Having advanced towards Balabeea, we found the reefs running northerly, and in some places near six leagues from the shore. Man of war birds, boobies, and tropic birds frequented this part of the sea in great numbers, hovering about our ship. [Thursday 15.]We discovered on the 15th, that there were three islands to the north of the west end of New Caledonia; but, as the reef extended very far to the east of them, and we could find no passage, it was impossible to form an exact idea of their figure and extent. The largest of them might be about seven leagues long. We were becalmed on the 15th, within four miles of the reef, towards which a heavy swell drifted us very visibly. In order to prevent striking on these dangerous rocks, we hoisted out two boats, and the crew were obliged to labour very hard to tow the ship off. A faint breeze in the evening gave them some respite, but at midnight they were obliged to return to their work, releasing each other from time to time. [Friday 16.]The morning was so calm that we went out to shoot birds, but had little success. We did not obtain a breeze till the evening came on, and then, instead of losing our time in farther researches to the northward, where we tried in vain to find a passage, we left that part, and prepared to range the south-east end of New Caledonia. The northernmost lands, which we had seen, lie in 19° 37' S. and 163° 40' E.</description>

<description>Early on the 24th, we came in sight of a cape which terminated New Caledonia to the east; it was rather steep, but of no great height, and perfectly level at the top to a considerable distance. A number of pillars stood upon it, which something invalidated the opinion of their being basalt-columns. This cape, which captain Cook named Queen Charlotte's Foreland, lies in 22° 15' S. and 167° 15' E. In the evening, towards six o'clock, another island was discovered far to the south-east from the mast-head, and the next morning several small islands appeared between New Caledonia and this new discovery, which the instability of the wind would not permit us to examine. We observed, however, that a great reef enclosed these islands, which seemed entirely to preclude a passage, and obliged us to stand on to the eastward, in order to weather all the distant land in sight. This part of our cruize was extremely disagreeable and tantalizing; we longed to have an opportunity of examining the country, and were at present in great distress for fresh food. A scanty portion of yams remained, which were eaten as dainties at the officers tables; but the crew had not tasted any refreshments since our departure from Namoka. The appearance of new lands made but little amends for the involuntary fast which we kept, and only supported our hopes of making some fortunate discovery, which might perhaps offer us fresh supplies.</description>

<description>We doubled the eastermost extremity of this island, and of its reefs, on the 28th, at day-break, and then bore away along its south-east shore. Captain Cook gave it the name of Isle of Pines, suspecting the columnar trees upon it to be of that kind. It seems to be about eighteen leagues in circumference, and the middle is situated in 22° 40' S. and 167° 40' E. The south-east wind, which had now set in very fresh, cooled the air so much in this latitude, that the thermometer sunk to 68°, which caused a disagreeable sensation to our bodies, long used to a warmer climate. [Thursday 29.]The next day we found a passage between several reefs, and came to an anchor off a little island, not above two miles in circuit, which was covered with tall columnar trees, though it was intirely flat and sandy. The south end of New Caledonia was not above six leagues distant from hence, and the southern coast of that island seemed to run nearly parallel to the northern, giving the whole a long, narrow shape. This south point, which was called the Prince of Wales's Foreland, lies in 22° 30' S. and 166° 58' E.</description>

<description>We hoisted a boat out immediately, and rowed to the little islet, which was about a mile and a half from us. It was surrounded with a small reef of its own, in which we found a narrow passage, containing many rocks, notwithstanding which we landed with safety. The tall trees immediately demanded our first attention, and we found that they belonged to the genus of cypresses. They were remarkably strait, and at least ninety or a hundred feet high. Their branches grew round the stem, forming little tufts, but seldom exceeded the length of ten feet, and were very slender in proportion. A variety of other trees and shrubs grew up between them, and rendered this little spot the resort of a great number of birds. We saw here also some scurvy-grass, and another plant (tetragonia), which we commonly made use of at New Zeeland in our soups. Captain Cook returned to the ship with us, after this discovery, intending to land again after dinner, in order to cut down some of the trees, and to collect some greens. We met with a variety of plants in the afternoon, which quite surprised us, on such a confined spot. We also saw some fire-places on its sandy shores, on which lay the remains of several turtles, which had probably afforded a delicious repast to some of the natives. A species of hawk was shot, which proved to be the common falco haliaëtos, or osprey See Mr. Pennant'sBritish Zoology.34 ; a kind of fly-catcher likewise fell into our hands, which was not known before; but besides this we saw several large beautiful pigeons, which we could not shoot. Flat-tailed water-snakes (anguis platura) were likewise numerous upon the island. The cypress-trees were found to be exceeding good timber, and the younger ones were very elastic, and fit for studding sail-booms. After rambling about this little spot till near sun-set, we all returned on board, and at day-light the next morning, [Friday 30.]weighed the anchor, and sailed slowly on to clear the reefs. Captain Cook gave this little islet the name of Botany Island, because it contained in so small a space a flora of near thirty species, among which we saw several new ones. Its situation is nearly 22° 28' S. and 167° 16' E. Its soil is very sandy on the shores, but in the interior part mixed with vegetable earth, from the trees and plants which continually decay on it, without being cleared away by human industry. Whilst we lay at anchor, the first lieutenant caught a fish, exactly of the same species with that which poisoned captain Cook, my father, and myself. He ordered it to be cleaned and boiled, in spite of the earnest representations of all his messmates, who warned him against its pernicious effects. It was at last set before him, by his positive orders, and his friends found no other means to save him, than to ridicule his mad design. Their humorous and satirical remarks had a better effect than friendly admonitions, and he desisted from the attempt. A little dog was, however, unfortunate enough to eat of the entrails of the fish, and lay several days in such exquisite torments, that it was at last thrown overboard, to put an end to its pain and misery. This circumstance proves to what great distresses we were now driven for want of fresh food, since even the risk of being poisoned was made light of, for the sake of a single meal. All our officers, who had made several voyages round the world, and experienced a multiplicity of hardships, acknowledged at present, that all their former sufferings were not to be compared to those of the present voyage, and that they had never before so thoroughly loathed a salt diet. Captain Cook had made a provision of dried hams for the voyage, which by length of time were much corrupted; all the fat being converted into a rancid oil, and the salt having filled the flesh with a quantity of alkaline concretions like tartar. However, as often as this putrid and loathsome meat was carried to table, which happened once a week, the petty officers devoured it with wistful looks, and spoke of our good fortune so feelingly, that it would have given pain to a savage. It was owing to our having such an excellent preservative as sour-krout on board, that the scurvy did not at this time make any considerable progress amongst us; but our situation was indeed wretched enough, without the additional horrors of disease.</description>

<description>[Wednesday 5.]On the fifth in the afternoon, we had sight of two albatrosses again, being between the 26th and 27th degree of south latitude. The calm which happened the day after, permitted our officers to go out in a boat, in order to shoot some birds; but after toiling the whole day, they brought on board only four, of which two were petrels, and two albatrosses. We were now once more on the confines of the easterly trade-wind, which so near the solstice became variable as soon as we had passed the tropic. On the 7th in the afternoon, we had a gentle breeze with which we sailed between the south and west; captain Cook being desirous to fall in with the west coast of New Zeeland in order to escape the same difficulties which we had experienced the year before in going into Cook's Strait. In the evening of the 8th, a numerous shoal of large porpesses passed the ship, and played about it, leaping frequently out of the water. One of them was struck with an harpoon, and by giving it a great deal of line, we had time to hoist a boat out, and to kill it with five musket shot. It was of that species which the ancients called the dolphinDeljiz, Aristot. Delphinus delphis, Linn. , and which, with the common porpess, is found in every sea. It was six feet long, and its dugs were full of milk, it being a viviparous animal of the class which suckle their own young. It was cut up the next morning, and the meat distributed to the ship's company; its colour was not very inviting, being almost black; but its taste after cutting away all the fat, was very like beef, only somewhat dry. We dined on it very heartily, and were very well contented with our good fortune. We saw land the same morning, which proved to be a small island, of moderate elevation, wholly covered with cypress-trees, resembling those we had found on Botany Island. We had soundings at a good distance, in twenty fathom more or less, and about nine o'clock were abreast of it. It seemed to be about two or three miles long, was very steep, almost entirely covered with woods, and to appearance uninhabited. Many aquatic fowls of different species were observed about it, which gave us hopes of making at least a provision of another fresh meal. We hastened to finish our dinner, and went on shore with captain Cook in two boats. Several large broken rocks project into the sea from the island, on all sides. We were fortunate enough to find a little cove so well sheltered by some of these rocks, that our boats lay very safe in it, and were able to land without wetting a foot. A heap of large stones formed a kind of beach, beyond which the shore rose very steep, and in some parts perpendicular. We found a little rill which descended in a cleft between two hills; and following the course of it, we penetrated into the woods with great difficulty, through a thick tissue of bindweeds and climbers. However, as soon as we had passed through this outward fence, we found the forest tolerably clear of underwood, and had not the least difficulty to walk forwards. The rocks of this island consisted of the common yellowish clayey stone, which we had found at New Zeeland; and in some places we met with small bits of porous reddish lava, which seemed to be decaying, but made us suspect this island to have had a volcano. The vegetables which we found upon it, throve with great luxuriance in a rich stratum of black mould, accumulated during ages past, from decaying trees and plants. The greatest number of species which we met with were well known to us, as belonging to the flora of New Zeeland, but they appeared here with all the advantages which a milder climate, and an exuberant soil could give them. The New Zeeland flag (phormium tenax), shot stalks eight or nine feet high, having flowers much larger and brighter than we had seen at Queen Charlotte's Sound. The productions of New Zeeland were here united to those of New Caledonia, and the New Hebrides; for the cypress of the one, and the cabbage palm which we had seen in the latter, flourished here in the greatest perfection. It was chiefly on these two species, that we bestowed our attention; the former supplied the carpenter with several spare booms, and pieces of timber; and the latter offered us a most welcome and palatable refreshment. We cut down several of them, and took on board the central shoot, or heart, which in taste more resembles an almond than a cabbage. The animal creation, like the vegetable, consisted chiefly of the same species which we found at New Zeeland. The parrots and parroquets were infinitely brighter coloured, though evidently of the same species; but the pigeon was exactly the same. We found besides these, a number of small birds, peculiar to this spot, some of which were very beautiful. On the beach we found several succulent plants, such as a species of tetragonia, and a mesembryanthemum, of which we gathered a quantity to boil in our soups. The melody of the birds was very pleasing in this little deserted spot, which if it had been of a greater size, would have been unexceptionable for an European settlement. We put off from it late in the evening, and when we arrived on board, we greatly regretted that we had not thought of leaving a hog of each sex, which would doubtless have propagated undisturbed, and in the space of a few years stocked the island, so as to become useful to future navigators. Captain Cook gave this pretty little spot, the name of Norfolk Island; it is situated in 29° 2' S. and 168° 16' E. Whilst we had examined the woods, some of the boats' crew had been no less busy in catching fish, having been fortunate enough to meet with a pool, where they had come in at high water. The tops of the cabbage-palm, these fish, and the birds which we had shot, afforded us an excellent refreshment for a day or two. We passed the S. E. end of the island the next morning, and saw a large single rock off that end. We sounded repeatedly all the forenoon, and found bottom at thirty and forty fathom, to the distance of eight leagues and upwards from the island. The vast number of boobies, and shear-waters, which were continually catching fish about us, by darting down into the sea, indicated that this was a kind of fishing-bank. At one o'clock in the afternoon, we were out of soundings, and advanced with a fresh breeze towards New Zeeland, where we could expect to meet with regular refreshments after our tropical cruize, which towards the latter end had greatly weakened the crew, by confining them to a putrid salt-diet, and which had proved particularly fatal to the officers and ourselves, by means of the poisonous fishes that unfortunately fell in our way.</description>

<description>We found the land to all appearance much more compact after passing Cape Noir; and [Monday 19.]the next morning in particular, the coast seemed to be entirely connected; the mountains rose to a much greater height, immediately from the sea-side, and were covered with snow in every part. The wind gradually lessened, and towards noon we were entirely becalmed, having the finest sun-shine, and mild weather. Many sorts of water-birds appeared about us from time to time, and several seals also sported in the water. In the afternoon about thirty grampusses were seen playing about us, chiefly swimming in couples. Another calm succeeded again [Tuesday 20.]the next day, though we had had an easterly wind during a part of the preceding afternoon. It was very amusing to us, to meet with mild weather in the neighbourhood of that tempestuous cape, of which the name alone has affrighted the mariners, ever since lord Anson's voyage.3 The destruction of vulgar prejudices is of so much service to science, and to mankind in general, that it cannot fail of giving pleasure, to every one sensible of its benefits. We had this day the thermometer at 48° which, considering the neighbourhood of the huge heaps of snow on shore, was very moderate. This part of the world has been called the Coast of Desolation by the navigators who first visited it, and seems fully to deserve the appellation. Here we discerned nothing but vast mountains, of which the spiry summits were every where covered with eternal snow. Along the sea, the nearest rocks were clear of snow, but black, and destitute of grasses or shrubbery. Some inlets appeared in different parts, where a few islands seemed to have a covering of green. We stood in to one of these in the evening, having then obtained an easterly breeze. A huge perpendicular wall of rock formed its western entrance, and captain Cook called it the York Minster, having discovered a strong resemblance between that Gothic building, and this dreary chaotic rock. It lies in 55° 30' S. and 70° 28' W. Along the coast we found regular soundings, but in the mouth of the inlet, we could not reach the bottom with one hundred and fifty fathom of line. This circumstance had already happened to us before at Dusky Bay (vol. I. p. 123); but as we saw a very spacious sound before us, we ventured to stand on, amidst different rude islands, on which the summits of hills were sometimes capt with snow. A boat was hoisted out, in which my father accompanied some of the lieutenants, who endeavoured to shoot birds, but brought only one on board. After being much retarded by calms, we arrived about nine o'clock in a small cove, indifferently sheltered either from wind or sea, but a welcome place of refuge on account of the approach of night. Here, then we dropped the anchor, which had been aweigh only forty-one days, during which we had crossed the South Sea in its full extent, from New Zeeland to Cape Deseado.</description>

<description>[Thursday 29.]In the afternoon we passed the island of St. Ildefonso, probably so called by Spanish navigators; after which we steered to the eastward whilst it was light, and tacked till the day broke. At six in the morning we passed Cape Horn, which is a large black rock, at the extremity of an island, lying before the Nassau inlet, discovered by Jacques l'Hermite See Recueil des Voyages qui ont servi à l'Etablissement, &amp;c. vol. IV. p. 696. . This famous cape has hitherto been ill placed in the charts, but the two voyages of captain Cook round it, have fixed its situation exactly at 55° 58' S. and 67° 46' W. After taking our leave of the South Sea, we steered for Le Maire's Strait, between Tierra del Fuego, and Staten Island. Towards evening, we came near enough to observe, that this side of Tierra del Fuego had a much milder aspect, than that about Christmas Sound. Here the land sloped down from the hills into long level points, covered with tall forests; and no snow was to be seen, except on the distant western mountains. We entered the strait the next morning, but were becalmed in it almost the whole day. Success Bay lay open to our eyes, and the country about it looked so rich and fertile, that we heartily wished to make some stay there.</description>

<description>The chace of these animals afforded great sport to our people; and the many singular circumstances which must strike the observer, in contemplating a species of animals associated into numerous herds, gave us much satisfaction. All these creatures were here in their proper climate; for the seals and sea-lions being loaded with an immense quantity of fat, and the shags and pinguins with a thick plumage, felt no inconvenience from the coolness of the weather. The captain obtained a considerable quantity of blubber, which was put into casks, and afterwards converted into oil; but a disagreeable putrid stench infected the whole ship for several days after leaving these New Year's Isles. In the evening our party returned from New Year's Harbour, on Staten Land, which they had found extremely safe and commodious. They brought with them some gulls, and five large ducks of the short-winged sort, which our sailors called race-horses. Each of these weighed sixteen pounds, but their meat was remarkably fetid, and not fit to be eaten. We spent the second of January in the same manner as the first, still making an acquisition of some new species of birds, with which this island, notwithstanding its small size, abounded. Among the rest we found a fine sort of grey curlew, with a yellow neck, which was one of the stateliest birds we had ever seen. The vegetable productions of this spot were confined to six or eight species, among which we saw some small shrubs not above three feet high, and a new plant; but the grass above mentioned (dactylis glomerata) occupied almost the whole surface of the island. In the evening we hoisted in all our boats, and [Tuesday 3.]the next morning at three o'clock we set sail, and doubled the N. E. end of Staten Land, which is named Cape St. John by father Feuillèe. A prodigious strong tide was observed to run past our ship every day whilst we lay at anchor, at the rate of four or five miles an hour. This is, however, so much the less remarkable, as the Straits of Magelhaens and the eastern coast of America, in high southern latitudes, are likewise known to have strong tides. The New Year's Islands, which we now left, are situated in 54° 46' S. and 64° 30' W. The largest of them is about six leagues, and that under which we lay at anchor appeared to be between three and four leagues in circuit. They are excellent places of refreshment for a ship's crew bound on expeditions like ours; for though the flesh of sea-lions and pinguins is not the most palatable food, yet it is infinitely more salubrious than salt meat; and by searching the different islands, it is not improbable that a sufficient quantity of celery and scurvy-grass might be found to supply the whole crew, especially as we saw both the species on our excursions. Our seamen lived several days on young shags and pinguins, of which they found the former extremely palatable, comparing them to young pullets. They likewise roasted several little cubs of seals, but there was a degree of softness in the meat which made it disgustful. The flesh of young but full-grown sea-bears was greatly preferable, and tasted like coarse and bad beef; but that of the old sea-lions and bears was so rank and offensive, that we could not touch it.</description>

<description>In the afternoon we saw two rocky islands at the north end of Georgia, which lay about a league asunder, and were of a dull black colour. We steered towards them, and about five o'clock passed in the middle between them. The northernmost was a craggy cliff, nearly perpendicular, which contained the nests of many thousand shags, and was named Willis's Island; it is situated in 54° S. and 38° 25' W. The southernmost sloped gradually to the westward, being covered on that side with some grass, and with innumerable flocks of birds of all sorts, from the largest albatrosses down to the least petrels, for which reason it was named Bird Island. Great numbers of shags, pinguins, divers, and other birds played about, and settled in the water around us, this cold climate seeming to be perfectly agreeable to them. Several porpesses were likewise noticed, and many seals were seen, which probably came to breed on these inhospitable shores.</description>

<description>We ran along the north-east coast of the land till it was dark, when we brought to, and did not resume our course till [Tuesday 17.]the next morning at three o'clock. The aspect of the land was extremely unpromising; the mountains were the most craggy we had ever seen, and formed many sharp points, between which the intervals were filled up with snow. We passed a bay, which, from the number of low green islands in it, was named the Bay of Islands, and opened another, towards which we stood with the ship, having soundings at the distance of two or three miles. About nine o'clock a boat was hoisted out, and captain Cook, accompanied by one midshipman, my father, Dr. Sparrman, and myself, went into the bay. We sounded in the entrance, but found no bottom with thirty-four fathom. Upon advancing into the furthest recess of the bay, we soon observed a solid mass of ice, such as is found in the harbours of Spitsbergen See the Hon. captain Phipp's (now lord Mulgrave's) Voyage towards the North Pole, 1775. , in the northern hemisphere. This mass of ice bore a great resemblance to those detached islands, of which we saw such numbers floating upon the ocean in the high southern latitudes. The shores of the bay, nearer the sea, were clear of snow, but excessively dreary, and almost perpendicular. We landed in a spot which was perfectly sheltered from the swell, and where the land formed a long projecting point. Here we saw a number of seals assembled on a stony beach, and among them a huge animal, which we had taken to be a rock at a distance, but which proved to be exactly the same animal with lord Anson's sea-lion. The midshipman shot it through the head whilst it lay fast asleep, and we afterwards found a younger one of the same sort. It was all over of a dark grey colour, with a slight olive cast, something like the seals in the northern hemisphere. It likewise resembled these animals in the more perfect shape of its fore feet, and the want of external ears. Its nose projected far beyond the mouth, and had a loose wrinkled skin, which may perhaps be occasionally puffed up when the animal is angry, and will in that case form something like the crest which has been figured in the print accompanying lord Anson's voyage. The animal which we examined was about thirteen feet long, but in proportion, of a more slender make than the sea-lion with a mane, which we saw at Staten Land This animal, or Anson's sea-lion, (phoca leonina, Linn.) seems to be the same which the English, at Falkland Island, have called the clapmatch seal.__See the Philos. Transact. vol. LXVI. part i.7 . Here we likewise found a flock of about twenty pinguins, of a much greater size than any we had hitherto seen; they were thirty-nine inches long, and weighed forty pounds. Their belly was of a most enormous size, and covered with a vast quantity of fat. An oval spot of bright yellow, or lemon colour, appears on each side of the head, and is edged with black, the rest of the body being of a blackish-grey colour on the whole back, and upper-side, and white on the belly, under the fins, and all the fore-part. These birds were so dull, as hardly to waddle from us; we easily overtook them by running, and knocked them down with sticks. When we returned on board, we found that they were mentioned by that great zoologist Mr. Pennant, in the Phil. Trans. by the name of Patagonian pinguins, and we likewise suppose them to be the same species which the English at the Falkland Islands, have named yellow, or king pinguins See the Philosophical Transactions, vol. LXVI. part i. . The seals which we found here, were more fierce, than any we had seen on the New Year's Isles, and did not run out of our way. The youngest cubs barked at us, and ran after our heels when we passed by them, trying to bite our legs. They were all of the species which I have before named sea-bears, (ursineseals, Penn.) and not a single sea-lion with a mane, was to be seen among them. We climbed upon a little hummock, about eight yards high, where we found two species of plants; one was the grass which grows plentifully on the New Year's Isles (dactylisglomerata) , and the other a kind of burnet (sanguisorba). Here captain Cook displayed the British flag, and performed the ceremony of taking possession of these barren rocks, " in the name of his Britannic Majesty, and his heirs for ever." A volley of two or three muskets was fired into the air, to give greater weight to this assertion; and the barren rocks re-echoed with the sound, to the utter amazement of the seals and pinguins, the inhabitants of these newly discovered dominions. The rocks consisted of a bluish grey slate, in horizontal strata, of which many fragments every where covered the beaches. As far as we were able to examine them, they contained no other minerals of any kind; the whole country being useless, and frightfully barren in every respect. We embarked soon after with a load of seals, pinguins, and shags, and leaving this bay, which was named Possession Bay, and is situated in 54° 15' S. and 37° 15' W. arrived safe on board before noon. During our stay on shore, we saw some small fragments of ice floating out to sea, and heard the huge masses in the farthest part of the bay, crack very loud from time to time. We continued to coast the land during the two following days, and discovered several bays and head-lands upon it, which were successively named Cumberland Bay, Cape George, Royal Bay, Cape Charlotte, and Sandwich Bay. The appearance of the land was always nearly the same; its mountains towards the south were excessively high, and divided into innumerable ragged points, like the flames in a raging fire. Mr. Hodges had drawn a very masterly view of part of this coast, where the horrors and caricatures of nature are faithfully copied, in that great style which is peculiar to him, and which animates all his views of savage countries. The drawings I here mention are engraved, and intended for captain Cook's account of this voyage.</description>

<description>On the 19th we reached the S. E. extremity of southern Georgia, which we now discovered to be an island, between fifty and sixty leagues in length. A rock which was named Cooper's Island, lies off the south end, in 54° 52' S. and 35° 50' W. We discovered at the same time, an island to the south-eastward, about fourteen leagues distant, of which we could not yet determine the size.</description>

<description>[Monday 23.]On the 23d, the same thick weather, being attended with a fresh breeze, we stood boldly on a tack, which all on board were firmly persuaded, would carry us directly from the land. Instead of that, about eleven o'clock, lieutenant Clerke saw the breakers scarce half a mile ahead, and several shags came to meet us, which seldom go to a greater distance from land. We now discovered that we had very providentially escaped being wrecked on the land, by making the circuit of it without knowing it. We put about instantly after this discovery, and stood off and on all day, as well as the next, because the same kind of thick fog, with frequent intervals of calm weather continued. In the evening however, the fog cleared for a little while, and gave us a fair view, both of the Isle of Georgia, and of the smaller one round which we had sailed. We found the latter of an inconsiderable size, and surrounded with other broken rocks; the whole dangerous group was therefore named Clerke's rocks, and lies in 55° S. and 34° 50' W.[Wednesd. 25.]Early on the 25th, we directed our course to the eastward, and afterwards somewhat southerly, in order to make another run towards the south before we returned into milder climates.</description>

<description>The discovery of this land happened on [Tuesday 31.]the 31st of January, at seven in the morning, when the weather was so hazy, that we could not see four or five miles around us. We ran towards it near an hour, when we were within half a mile of the rocks, which were black, cavernous, and perpendicular to a vast height, inhabited by flocks of shags, and beaten by dreadful breakers. Thick clouds veiled the upper parts of the mountains, but one immense peak appeared towering beyond them, covered with snow. It was agreed by all present, that the perpendicular height of this mountain could not be far short of two miles. We sounded with 170 fathom close in shore, and then put about, standing to the south, in order to weather the western point, which we had now discovered. We had not run above an hour on this tack, when we saw high mountains to the S. S. E. about five or six leagues distant, which, from the course we had kept, we must have narrowly escaped about midnight. This being the southernmost extremity of the land, my father named it Southern Thule, a name which captain Cook has preserved. It is situated in 59° 30' S. and 27° 30' W. At one o'clock in the afternoon we put about, and stood to the northward, beyond the point which we had first seen. This now appeared to be a black rock, separated from a great projecting head-land. The rock was named Freezeland's Head, from a German sailor who first discovered it, and lies in 58° 55' S. and 27° W. The head-land, which has since been named Cape Bristol, appeared to be connected with the Southern Thule, by some lands which we saw very far to the eastward, forming a spacious bay. Captain Cook, however, did not venture to lose any time in the investigation of this coast, where he was exposed to imminent danger from the violence of westerly winds. He chose rather to explore its northern extremities, which besides, were doubtless the most likely to be of importance to navigators. We kept at the distance of two or three leagues from the land, having little winds, and seeing the coast every where steep and inaccessible. The mountains appeared to be of vast height, their summits being constantly wrapped in clouds, and the lower part covered with snow down to the water's edge in such a manner, that we should have found it difficult to pronounce whether we saw land or ice, if some hollow rocks had not shewn their black and naked caverns in several places.</description>

<description>[1775. February.][Wednesd. 1.]We found ourselves abreast of another projecting point in the morning, which captain Cook has since named Cape Montague, and which seems to be connected with Cape Bristol, a kind of bay lying between them. Beyond it we discovered another point to the north, which upon our nearer approach was found to be a separate island, and named Saunders's Island. It was not inferior in height to the moutainous coast to the south of it, and was covered with snow and ice in the same manner. It is situated in 57° 48' S. and 26° 35' W.</description>

<description>The wind permitted us the next day to approach the Candlemas Isles, in order to ascertain their situation, which we found to be in 57° 10' S. and 27° 6' W. We now steered to the eastward, and lost sight of the southern land, having doubled its northern extremity. Captain Cook at first gave it the general name of Snowland, but afterwards honoured it with that of Sandwich Land. I am inclined to believe that this land has been discovered by those early navigators, who have furnished the geographers with the Gulph of St. Sebastian, and the isle of Cressalina. It remains very doubtful, whether the different projecting points of Thule, Cape Bristol, and Cape Montague, form one connected land, or several distinct islands; and this may probably continue undetermined for ages to come, since an expedition to those inhospitable parts of the world, besides being extremely perilous, does not seem likely to be productive of great advantages to mankind. It was the object of our hazardous voyage to explore the southern hemisphere to the sixtieth degree of latitude, and to ascertain the existence of a southern continent in the temperate zone. Our different tracks have not only rendered it evident, that a continent does not exist in the temperate southern zone, but have likewise made it probable, by advancing into the frigid zone to seventy one degrees south, that the space within the antarctic circle is far from being every where filled up with land. The existence of such a continent has been believed by the most philosophic enquirers of the present age; and this opinion, though now so much invalidated, is nevertheless a proof of their great intelligence, considering the few data upon which they could proceed. Without ascertaining whether Sandwich Land is part of a greater tract, it may not be improper to mention, that one of the reasons alledged in favour of a continent, has lately been overthrown by experiments. It has always been supposed that the ice, which is seen floating in immense quantities on the sea, must be formed on shore from snow or fresh water; but it has now been proved that sea-water will freeze, and that the ice which is thus formed does not contain any particles of salt, except where it comes in contact with the water, which introduces itself into its pores and interstices See Mr. Nairne's Experiments in the LXVI. vol. of the Philosophical Transactions, part i. .10 </description>
