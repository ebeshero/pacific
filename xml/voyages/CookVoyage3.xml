                <head>Containing an Account of what happened in prosecuting the Voyage to the
                    North, to determine the Existence or Non-existence of a Passage between the
                    great Pacific and Atlantic Oceans in that Hemisphere.</head>
                <p>HAVING taken leave of the islands with which we were before acquainted in the
                    southern hemisphere, we now directed our course to the northward, to explore
                    coasts and countries hitherto unvisited by any English voyager, and but lately
                    known to the navigators of other countries.</p>
                <pb n="178"/>
                <p>We took our departure from the Society Isles, as has already been said, on the
                    9th of December, 1777, steering N. by E. as near as the winds would let us, with
                    mostly fine weather till the 20th, when in lat. 4.54. S. we were surrounded with
                    land and sea weeds, and bodies of trees, which seemed to be but lately separated
                    from their respective roots; but it was not till The 23d that we discovered
                    land. On that day, in lat. 2. N. long. 203.15. E. after having crossed the line
                    the day before, the man at the mast-head called out land, bearing N. E. distance
                    between six and seven leagues. We instantly wore ship, and stood in for a fine
                    bay, on which we found good anchorage in 48 fathom water. On viewing the island
                    from the ships, there did not appear the least sign of an inhabitant; but near
                    the shore there were shoals of sharks, and the sea seemed crusted over with
                    sea-fowls, some of a very large size. The boats that had been sent out to
                    reconnoitre returned in the evening with one large turtle each, and loaded with
                    boobies and other tropical birds, that by hungry mariners are generally
                    esteemed good eating. They likewise brought several sharks, which they found in
                    such crowds, that they knocked them on the head with their oars.</p>
                <p>On the 24th we changed our station, and anchored in 17 fathom water.</p>
                <p>And on the 25th we kept Christmas in much mirth and festivity, the crew having
                    plenty of provisions, and the Gentlemen plenty of turtle. The ships being safely
                    moored, and the weather fine, but almost insupportably hot, the men were allowed
                    the whole day to amuse themselves, and every one had a pint of brandy to make
                    merry, and drink health to their friends in Old England.</p>
                <pb n="179"/>
                <p>In the evening, parties from both ships were invited to go a turtling, but none
                    were pressed into that service, all were volunteers. On our landing, the crews
                    went different ways; and in order to know where to meet, fires were made in
                    separate directions; one fire for the Resolution's party, and one for that of
                    the Discovery's. Our party before morning had turned more than 20 turtles, and
                    had carried them on board; and when the boats were unloaded, returned for more.
                    In the mean time, a fishing party were likewise sent out, and were no less
                    successful than the turtlers; hut on this service a seaman had a very narrow
                    escape. As he was helping to draw the seine, a shark made a chop at his arm, but
                    fortunately caught only a piece of his shirt's sleeve, with which he made
                    off.</p>
                <p>The Resolution's turtlers had made a trip to their ship to unlade; but on the
                    return of their boats to the island, one of their men was missing, who, tired
                    with carrying a turtle of more than 100 weight in the heat of the day, had laid
                    it down on the beech, and retired to a thicket, to shelter himself from the sun.
                    Here he fell asleep, and as soon as he awoke, be endeavoured to recover his
                    turtle, but in vain; he had entangled himself among the bushes, and in the
                    evening, after a most painful search, he was found almost speechless through
                    fatigue and want of refreshment.</p>
                <p>All this day our people continued their diversion on the S. E. side of the
                    island; but On the 26th, about ten in the morning, Mr. B—y, Mr. E—r, and Mr.
                    P—k, with ten or twelve seamen in the cutter, having a good quantity of water on
                    board, and each man a pint of brandy, directed their course to the N. E.
                    quarter, and about noon arrived at a neck of land, <pb n="180"/> over which
                    they were to travel on foot to come at the place where the turtle were supposed
                    to harbour, and where it was dangerous to attempt to approach them by sea by
                    reason of the surf. Here they safely secured their cutter, and near the shore
                    they erected a kind of hut, to which they carried their provisions, and sat down
                    to rest and to refresh. This done, they agreed to divide, and to pursue their
                    sport in separate parties. Accordingly they set out, and before the next morning
                    they had sent in as many turtle as the cutter could well stow. This they did by
                    placing them across a couple of oars in the nature of a bier, and keeping men
                    employed in conveying them from the place where they were turned, to the
                    cutter. As they grew tired of their diversion, they repaired to the place of
                    rendezvous; but it was some surprize to the rest, when at nine in the morning,
                    Mr. B—y, Mr. P—k and Simeon Woodrooff, the gunner's mate, was missing. It was
                    then concluded that they had gone too far within land, and that they had either
                    lost their way, or some accident had befallen them; perhaps from natives
                    lurking secretly in the woods, though none had openly appeared.</p>
                <p>Under these apprehensions two seamen, Bartholomew Loremer and Thomas Trecher
                    were sent out in search of them, each carrying a gallon of water, with brandy
                    and other refreshments, in case they should meet with the Gentlemenn their way.
                    In a wild uncultivated country, over-run with bushes and close cover, the
                    reader, who has never been bewildered in a full-grown thicket after sport, can
                    have no idea of men's being lost in the short space of a few miles. So, however
                    it happened. The Gentlemen, invited by the mixed melody of the birds in the
                    woods, left these people as soon as they had properly stationed them, <pb
                        n="181"/> and entered an adjoining thicket, with their guns. The sport they
                    met with led them on till night began to close upon them. They were then at a
                    distance from the turtlers, and in the midst a trackless cover, with nothing but
                    lew trees to direct their return; but what was more alarming, the sun was no
                    sooner set, than a thick fog succeeded, which involved the woods in darkness,
                    though the open beach remained clear. In vain they attempted to regain the
                    shore; for, instead, of being able to discern the trees they had marked to
                    secure their retreat, they could hardly see one another at five yards distance.
                    In this situation, they soon began to lose all knowledge of their way; and lest,
                    instead of proceeding in the right course, they should pursue a contrary
                    direction, they agreed to sit down to rest, and for that purpose chose the
                    first convenient spot that chance threw in their way. Though their minds were
                    troubled, they had scarce set themselves down, when sleep got the better of
                    their anxiety, and they all lay composed till attacked by swarms of black ants,
                    (creatures more poisonous than bugs) with which they were in a manner covered
                    when they awoke; and so disfigured and tormented with their bites and blisters,
                    that it is hardly possible to desribe their distress. Thus circumstanced, their
                    first care was to clear themselves from these vermin, by stripping themselves,
                    and sweeping them off with brushes made of the wings of the birds they had
                    killed; this done, they clothed themselves again, in order to renew their
                    atttempts to recover the shore; but all in vain. The farther they walked, as it
                    appeared afterwards, the farther they went astray. At length, suspecting their
                    error, they resolved to remain stationary; and each man, placing himself against
                    an adjoining tree, endeavoured <pb n="182"/> to console himself as well as he
                    could till morning, when the appearance of the sun should enable them to judge
                    of the course they were to pursue; but in a trackless wilderness how were they
                    to make their way! The thicket in many places was overgrown with thick grass and
                    brambles reaching; to their middles, and in others so thick intersected with
                    boughs, and matted with leaves, that it was hardly possible to keep company, or
                    to penetrate with their utmost efforts, when these obstructions happened) one
                    hundred yards in as many minutes. Still, however, labouring to advance, they,
                    at length, all at once, observed an opening that led, as they thought, to the
                    long-wished for shore. They forgot, for the moment, the pains of their lacerated
                    limbs, though all torn with briars and besmeared with blood, and comforted
                    themselves with the hope of a speedy deliverance. But they had still a journey
                    of about seven or eight miles to perform, before they could reach the place from
                    whence they set out. Almost spent with fatigue, and their spirits wasted with
                    the most painful exertion of bodily strength, without having a drop of water to
                    quench their intolerable thirst, they at length arrived at the hut, when, to
                    their great mortification, they found it deserted, and destitute of every kind
                    of refreshment. In this situation casting their eyes towards the ships, they
                    perceived the boats hastening to their relief. The officer who commanded, and
                    the crew, had waited at the hut till all their provisions were expended, and
                    the officer not knowing how to proceed, had repaired to the ship for a fresh
                    supply, and for fresh orders, and was now returning fully furnished and
                    instructed. On his arrival he was struck with astonishment at the sight of three
                    such miserable beings, as the Gentlemen and Mate <pb n="183"/> appeared to be,
                    lacerated all over, and besmeared with blood, and with scarce a rag about them
                    broader than a garter. Their cry was for grog, which was dealt to them
                    sparingly, and they were instantly sent on board to be properly taken care
                    of.</p>
                <p>The first enquiry they made, was, whether any of the company had been sent after
                    them; and being answered in the affirmative, and that they were not yet
                    returned, they could not help expressing their doubts whether they ever would
                    return; adding their wishes at the same time, that no means might be omitted to
                    endeavour their recovery.</p>
                <p>It is natural for men, who have just experienced any signal deliverance, to feel
                    poignantly for the safety of others under the same critical circumstances. It
                    was therefore no small satisfaction to the sufferers, when they were told, that
                    every possible means would be tried for the poor men's relief; and to enable
                    those who were to be sent on that errand the better to direct their search, the
                    gentlemen described, as well as they could, the spot where they thought they
                    heard men halloo to one another about the dawn of day. There were now twenty of
                    the crew (seamen and marines) who had been dispatched from on board, for
                    recovering the gentlemen. These had orders to traverse the thickets in a body,
                    till they should find one or other of them, either living or dead; for, till the
                    gentlemen appeared, nothing could be concluded with certainty concerning them.
                    The majority were of opinion, that, if they had been alive, they most certainly
                    would have returned as soon as it was dark, as they could have no motive to
                    pursue their sport in the night; and it was by no means probable, that they
                    should be bewildered, because they might surely have found <pb n="184"/> the
                    same way out of the cover, by which they went into it. This was very plausible;
                    but 〈◊〉 on board, who had sailed with Commodore Byron, and who remembered the
                    almost impenetrable thickets in the island of Tinian, where men could not see
                    one another in open day, at the distance of five yards, knew well how the
                    gentlemen might be entangled, and how hard it would fare with them if it should
                    so happen. But, as this instance was known only to few, it was regarded by none;
                    and the former opinion, that some fatal accident had happened to them,
                    prevailed generally till the gentlemen appeared, when the whole mystery was
                    unravelled.</p>
                <p>Early in the morning of the next day, (the two men being still missing) the whole
                    party assembled, and the plan of their proceeding was formed. By marching in
                    lines at such a distance from each other, as to be within hearing, it was
                    thought impossible to fail of finding the men, if living, or of discovering some
                    traces of them, if dead: and they were to direct their line of march towards
                    the spot where the sound of the voices was heard by the gentlemen.</p>
                <p>After a diligent search of six hours, Bartholomew Loreman was discovered in a
                    most miserable condition, almost blinded by the venomous bites of vermin, added
                    to the scorching heat of the sun, and speechless for want of something to clear
                    his throat. He made signs for water, and water was given him. He had got out of
                    the thicket, and was wandering about upon the beech, without being sensible of
                    the miserable condition in which he was found. It fortunately happened, that a
                    boat from the Discovery had been sent round the point of land already mentioned,
                    and stationed near where the turtlers had been employed the <pb n="185"/> night
                    before, for the purpose of taking the gentlemen on board, in case they should
                    have been strayed to any considerable distance. If this precaution had not been
                    taken, this man must have perished before he could have been conveyed by any
                    other means to the place of rendezvous; and it was with the utmost difficulty
                    that he was carried to the nearest boat. As soon as he could be brought to his
                    speech, he said he had parted from his companion Trecher in the morning, not in
                    anger, but not agreeing about the way back, nor ever expecting to see one
                    another again. They had traversed the thicket as long as they were able, in
                    search of the gentlemen without success; and when overcome with fatigue, they
                    sat down to refresh, and he believed had drank a little too freely of the grog
                    they had in charge, for they both fell asleep. They were frightened when they
                    waked to find it dark night; and although they felt their faces and hands
                    covered with vermin, the thoughts of having neglected their duty, and the dread
                    of the consequences so distracted their minds, that they were hardly sensible of
                    any other pain. As rest was now no longer their object, they rose and wandered,
                    they neither knew nor cared where, till day began to break upon them. In the
                    mean time, several wild projects came into their heads. At last they thought of
                    climbing the highest tree, to try if they could discover any hill or eminence,
                    from whence they might take a view of the country, in order to be certain
                    whether it was inhabited or not. This was approved of by both, and Trecher
                    mounted the loftiest within his reach, from whence he said he could discern,
                    towards the South-west, a hill of considerable height; and as that was, as he
                    thought, the point that led to the <pb n="186"/> shore, thither he proposed that
                    they should go; but Loreman rather chose to endeavour to regain the shore by
                    another course; and as he thought he heard the report of a gun the evening
                    before, he determined to make towards the point from whence the sound proceeded;
                    and in that he happened to judge right; and when he got out of the wood, being
                    parched with thirst, he killed a turtle and sucked the blood. His companion, he
                    said, who was at some distance farther in the thicket, and who did not hear the
                    report of the gun, did not believe what he said; whereupon they agreed to part.
                    What course Trecher took he could not tell, but he believed to the
                    South-west.</p>
                <p>Loreman was judged in too dangerous a condition to admit of any delay; he was
                    therefore sent off in the boat, and being put under the care of the Surgeon,
                    soon recovered.</p>
                <p>After this detail it was debated, whether to resign Trecher to his fate, or to
                    continue the search. The humanity of the officer, who had the command of the
                    party, prevailed. It was now about ten in the morning, of the 29th, when the
                    whole party, after taking some refreshment, set out to scour the thickets, and,
                    by hallooing, ringing of bells, beating of drums, and pursuing different
                    courses, determined he should hear them if he were alive. It was no easy task to
                    penetrate a trackless cover, over-grown with underwood, and abounding with
                    infects, of which the musquitoes were the least troublesome. But numbers make
                    that easy, which to individuals would be impracticable. They went on chearfully
                    at first; but, before a few hours were elapsed, even the gentlemen, who were
                    inspirited by their success in killing game, began to be tired, and it was
                    thought adviseable to rest and refresh <pb n="187"/> during the middle of the
                    day, and to renew the pursuit after they had dined. As yet they had not been
                    able to discover any trace or track of the man they were seeking, though it had
                    been agreed between Trecher and his companion, to cut boughs from the trees, as
                    they passed along, by way of mark or guide to each other, in case of
                    separation.</p>
                <p>This was no small discouragement; and few had any relish to renew a labour
                    attended with so much fatigue, and so little prospect of success.</p>
                <p>The officers were alone inflexibly bent on the pursuit. The men, though they were
                    no less willing, were not all equally able to endure the fatigue; and some of
                    them were even ready to drop, before their dinner and their grog had revived
                    their spirits. The only expedient that now remained to be tried, was, that which
                    Trecher himself had projected, namely, to climb the highest tree that appeared
                    in view, in order to look for the hill which he pretended to have seen, and to
                    which it was thought probable that he might direct his course. This was no
                    sooner proposed than executed. In a moment a sailor was perched at the top of
                    every lofty tree in sight, and the high land descried, seemingly at no great
                    distance from the place where the party had dined. It was now agreed, to make
                    the best of their way to the eminence, but this proved not so easy a task as it
                    at first appeared to be. When they thought themselves just ready to mount, they
                    met with a lagoon that interrupted their progress; and coasting it along, they
                    discovered the skeleton of a creature that, by its length, appeared to be an
                    allegator. In viewing this narrowly, something like the track of some large
                    animal was observed to have passed it, and the high grass <pb n="188"/> on the
                    margin of the lagoon to have been fresh trodden. This excited the curiosity of
                    the whole party, who imagined that some monster inhabited the lagoon, against
                    which it was prudent for them to be upon their guard. The waters of the lagoon
                    were salt as brine, and every where skirted with a kind of reed and sedge, that
                    reached as high as a man's head, and could not be penetrated without danger
                    from scorpions or other venomous reptiles, several of which had been seen in the
                    bushes. All attempts therefore of succeeding by this course appeared to be
                    labour lost; and as no other were thought more probable, it was resolved to
                    relinquish the pursuit, and to return to the boats: but the day being already
                    too far spent to make their return practicable before the morning, it was
                    agreed to coast it along the lake, to endeavour to find access to the opposite
                    hills; and this was the more easily effected, as between the sedgey border and
                    the thicket there was an open space of unequal breadth, only sometimes
                    intersected with brambley patches that joined the lake, but of no great extent.
                    Through these they made their way with little opposition till the lake appeared
                    to deepen, when a most stubborn woody copse seemed to bid defiance to their
                    further progress. This difficulty, however, was with much labour surmounted, and
                    it was no sooner passed, than the lake was found to terminate, and the ground to
                    rise. The country began now to put on a new face. The prospect which had
                    hitherto presented nothing but a wild and almost impenetrable thicket, as they
                    ascended the rising ground, became delightful. And when they had attained the
                    summit of the eminence, was exceedingly picturesque. Here they determined to
                    pass the night within a pleasant pb n="189"/> grove, which seemed to be
                    designed by nature for a place of rest. The whole party now assembled, and
                    orders were given by the commanding officers to erect temporary huts to
                    shelter them from the evening damps. These huts were only boughs and leaves of
                    trees set up tent fashion. In this service some were employed in cutting down
                    and preparing the materials, while others were busied in dispossing and putting
                    them together; some were ordered to collect fuel, and others to carry it to the
                    summit of an adjoining hill, in order to be kindled at the close of day, and
                    kept burning during the night, by way of signal, to let the man know, if alive,
                    where to repair; and the ships, that the party were safe. Before night set in
                    the huts were completed, the fire was lighted, the sentinel at his station, the
                    watch set, and the party all retired to rest, when, about the dead of night, the
                    sentinel who attended the fire, was surprized by a four-footed monster. This
                    monster, upon examination, proved no other, than the identical Thomas Trecher,
                    of whom they had been in search so long, crawling upon all sours; for his feet
                    were so blistered, that he could not stand, and his throat so parched that he
                    could not speak. It is hard to say which was predominant, their joy, their
                    surprize, or their laughter. No time, however, was lost in administering comfort
                    to the poor man. He was a most affecting spectacle, blistered from head to foot
                    by poisonous insects, whose venomous stings had caused such an intolerable
                    itching, that his very blood was inflamed by constant rubbing. By anointing him
                    with oil, the acrimony, in some degree, abated; and by frequently giving him
                    small quantities of tea, mixed with a little brandy, they brought him to his
                    speech; but it was some <pb n="190"/> days before he recovered the perfect use
                    of his faculties.</p>
                <p>The absence the whole night of the party sent out in search of him, having been
                    reported to Capt. Cook, he had ordered two boats into the lagoon, to go
                    different ways, to assist in the search; but being in the evening relieved from
                    his anxiety, he recalled the boats, and gave orders to prepare for sailing.</p>
                <p>We had now been off this island near 7 days, in which time we had taken more than
                    300 turtle, from 90 to 100 lb. weight on board. But tho' it seemed more than 60
                    leagues in circumference, there were not the smallest traces of any human being
                    having ever been upon it before: and, indeed, should any people be so
                    unfortunate as to be accidentally driven upon it, they could not possibly exist
                    for any length of time. There are, it is true, many birds, and abundance of
                    fish, but no visible means of allaying thirst, nor any vegetable that could
                    supply the place of bread. On the few cocoa-trees upon the island, the number of
                    which did not exceed thirty, very little fruit was found; and in general, what
                    was found, was either not fully grown, or had the juice salt or brackish; so
                    that a ship touching here, must expect nothing but fish and turtle; but not a
                    drop of fresh water was to be found throughout the island.</p>
                <p>On the 1st of January, 1778, about ten in the morning, we unmoored, and set sail,
                    with the Resolution in company, directing our course N. by E. with a gentle
                    breeze from the East.</p>
                <p>To the island which we had just left, Capt. Cook gave the name of Christmas
                    Island, leaving in it a bottle, with a similar inscription to that cut on Omai's
                    house, the date only excepted. It lies <pb n="191"/> in lat. 1.59. N. and in
                    long. 201. E. from Greenwich. It is a low barren island, and has all the
                    appearance of having been blighted. The few cocoa-nut trees that were found
                    upon it, produced hardly any fruit, and, except a few on the borders of the
                    lagoon already mentioned, what they bore were without kernels.</p>
                <p>Early on the 2d of January, Christmas Island bore S. S. E. as far as the eye
                    could carry, and as we were now clear of land, and proceeding with a prosperous
                    gale, and had plenty of provisions on board, the men were allowed turtle to boil
                    with their pork; which, however, in a few days was discontinued by the advice
                    of the Surgeon, and turtle substituted in the room of every other kind of meat.
                    This was found both healthful and nourishing, and was continued till within a
                    few days of our arrival at another island, where we met with fresh provisions,
                    and water equal to any we brought with us from the Society Isles.</p>
                <p>On the 3d, the wind shifted W. S. W. and a storm came on, preceded by a louring
                    darkness, that presaged some violent convulsion; and soon after it broke forth
                    in thunder, lightning, wind, and rain, which in two hours increased to such a
                    violent degree, as no man on board had ever known the like. Fortunately for us,
                    its violence in a few hours abated; but in that little time the sea broke over
                    our quarter, and cleared the decks of every thing that was loose. Before noon,
                    the wind subsided, but the rain continued till evening, of which we made good
                    use. From the time of our leaving Ulietea to the present day, we had received no
                    fresh supply of water; and, though the still had been constantly at work, our
                    complement began already to run scanty. This afternoon, several indications of
                    land were observed; <pb n="192"/> such as great quantities of sea-weed floating
                    about the ships, and fresh timber driving with the current. The Resolution made
                    the signal to shorten sail and stand to the Southward, which was obeyed; but, no
                    land coming in sight while it was day-light, after eight hours search we left
                    off the pursuit, and resumed our course to the Northward, which we continued
                    till The 13th, when, in lat. 13.3. long. 202.6. we steered to the N. W. in
                    search of land, the signs of which were very striking; but, after continuing
                    that course all night without succeeding, we again stood to the North. From
                    this time till The 20th, nothing material happened, some slight storms excepted;
                    we shall therefore •••…me our relation of what occurred to Trecher, from the
                    time that he parted from his companion, on the 29th of December, till the night
                    he was found on the 3d.</p>
                <p>It was, as has already been observed, several days, before he could perfectly
                    recollect all that passed in his mind, and all that he suffered in his person.
                    He confirmed Loreman's relation of what passed while they remained together;
                    but, in the morning of the 29th, when they agreed to part, his thoughts ran
                    chiefly on discovering some house or place of resort of the natives, as it ran
                    strongly in his mind, that an island of such extent as that appeared to be,
                    could not be wholly destitute of inhabitants. In pursuit of this idea, he
                    determined to make towards the hill or high land, which he had seen from the top
                    of the tree; and to observe the course of the sun for his guide, but he met with
                    many obstructions that retarded his progress. The reeds and the rough grass were
                    in many places so high and thick, that he was almost <pb n="193"/> suffocated in
                    attempting to get through them, and was frequently obliged to return, when he
                    thought he had nearly reached the opposite side. Though there were serpents,
                    and, he believed, scorpions, continually bissing, in almost all directions, the
                    fear of being stung by them was absorbed by the more immediate torture he felt
                    from the musquitoes, and other venomous insects, that fastened upon him, and
                    teized him incessantly; add to these distresses, the bad condition of his shoes,
                    which were worn to shreds; and, though he tied them round and round with cords
                    made of twisted grass, yet it was hardly possible for him to keep them upon his
                    feet for ten steps together. In this melancholy situation, rest was a stranger
                    to him; yet sleep would sometimes close his eyes, and fill his imagination with
                    horrors still more distressing than those he felt while awake. Towards the
                    evening of the 29th, he thought he heard the howling of dogs; and, a-while
                    after, the growling of some savage beast, but of what species he could not tell;
                    however, he saw nothing, and these might only be the creatures of his own
                    disturbed fancy. Towards night he got together a quantity of broad leaves from
                    the trees to make him a bed, and to cover his face and hands from the black
                    ants. To allay his thirst, he thought of chewing the stems of a reed, that had a
                    saccharine taste, and was probably a wild kind of sugar-cane, which gave him
                    some refreshment, and contributed not a little to his preservation. Soon as
                    day began to dawn, he found himself weak and languid, and had very little
                    stomach to renew his labour. His first care, however, was to repair his shoes.
                    This he did by forming wisps of grass into the shape of soals, and placing them
                    underneath the remains of the leather pb n="194"/> soals. He then tied them
                    together round his feet and ankles with cords, made as before; and with these he
                    made shift to scramble on a-while, but they soon wanted repair. He again had
                    recourse to his first expedient, and mounted a tree that over-topped the cover,
                    and got sight of the high land that first animated his pursuit. He thought it so
                    near that he could soon reach it; and, hastening down, made his way with more
                    alacrity than ever, being prepossessed that if he reached that eminence, his
                    deliverance would be certain. For some hours he struggled through the most
                    formidable obstacles, the cover being now so thick and strong, and withal so
                    high, that he could hardly see the light over his head through the leaves and
                    the bushes. This happened to be the outer border that skirted the lagoon, which
                    when he had penetrated, and found an opening, his heart leaped within him; but
                    his joy was or short duration. He presently discovered that he had another
                    difficulty to furmount, before he could reach the summit of his wishes. He
                    attempted the lagoon, and waded nearly across, without the water rising higher
                    than his middle, but all at once plunged over-head in deep water, and it was
                    next to a miracle that he saved himself from drowning. He then returned quite
                    exhausted and dejected, and breaking through the sedge of the margin of the
                    lake, he stumbled upon the skeleton of the monster already mentioned, which he
                    believed was fifty feet long. He was so scared at the fight of the bones, that
                    his hair stood on-end, and he thought of nothing now but being eaten up alive.
                    Totally dispirited, and faint for want of food or any thing to drink, and
                    deprived of all means of proceeding any farther, he crept along the lake till
                    he came to a <pb n="195"/> cocoa-nut tree near the edge of the thicket, which he
                    attempted to climb, but fell down for want of strength to keep his hold, and lay
                    for several hours incapable of motion. He heard, he said, a noise in the cover,
                    in the day, but could neither halloo to be heard, nor follow the sound, though
                    some of the company must have passed very near him; but seeing the fire lighted
                    on the hill in the evening, it encouraged him to make one struggle more for
                    life. Without a shoe to his foot, having lost them in the lake, he made shift to
                    crawl up the hill, as already related. Few readers will think it possible for a
                    man to suffer so much in so short a time; and yet many have lost their lives by
                    being bewildered in England, and many more on the wild heaths in Scotland,
                    which cannot be supposed to be so dangerous as the thick cover of a desolate
                    island, where no man ever set his foot before. But, be that as it may, such is
                    the account given by Trecher, of his sufferings during the three days he was
                    absent from the ship.</p>
                <p>Having now been 17 days at sea, without seeing land, On the 18th, a very severe
                    storm arose, which blew with irrestible fury for some hours, and obliged us to
                    clue up our main sheets, and scud bofore it, at the rate of seven or eight knots
                    an hour; but before noon the wind died away, and a dead calm succeeded. Such is
                    the variableness of the weather near the tropics.</p>
                <p>On the 19th, being then in lat. 21.12. N. and long. 200.41. E. the man at the
                    mast-head called out, High land, bearing E. N. E. and in a very little time came
                    in sight of more land, apparently of an equal height with the former. As we
                    approached the windward island, it presented no very promising aspect, being
                    mountainous, and <pb n="196"/> surrounded with reefs, without any signs of
                    inhabitants; we therefore stood off and on till The 20th, when we bore away for
                    the land to leeward, but not then in sight.</p>
                <p>About nine in the morning, it was seen the second time, at the distance of about
                    seven or eight leagues. We were charmed with its appearance as we came near it,
                    observing it to abound with rivers, and to exhibit a prospect so full of plenty,
                    that we anticipated the pleasure we expected, by supposing ourselves already in
                    possession of a most seasonable supply. We had been for several days reduced to
                    the scanty allowance of a quart of water a-day, and that none of the best; and
                    now that we saw, or thought we saw, whole rivers before us, our hearts were
                    dilated with joy; yet we had still much to suffer. We found ourselves debarred
                    from the thing we were most in want of for several days, by shoals and rocks
                    that to us were impracticable. We coasted along the N. W. side of the island,
                    sounding as we went, while the boats from both ships were employed in searching
                    for some bay or harbour, where we might safely anchor. In the mean time,
                    several canoes came from the shore with plantains and dried fish on board, who
                    parted with what they had for any trifles that were offered them; and at first
                    behaved with great civility, but could not be persuaded to venture on board. At
                    five in the evening, we were two leagues from the shore, surrounded by Indians
                    in their canoes, with hogs in abundance, some very large, which we purchased
                    according to their size, for a spike or a ten-penny nail each.</p>
                <p>While we remained at sea, no people on earth could be more friendly; but our
                    boats had no sooner landed, than a quarrel arose between the <pb n="197"/>
                    natives and our people, which was terminated by the death of one of the former.
                    It was said that the Indians were the aggressors, by throwing stones at the
                    boats to prevent the people from landing, and that orders being given to fire a
                    gun over the heads of the assailants, without doing them any hur; tinstead of
                    commanding respect, it only encouraged them in insolence, till Mr. W—, our
                    third Lieutenant, presenting his piece, shot one of the ringleaders dead upon
                    the spot.</p>
                <p>This early act of severity was probably the means of saving many lives. The
                    Indians dispersed immediately, carrying off the dead body with them. And the
                    boats, not having made any discovery, returned to the ships, where they were
                    taken on board, and secured till next morning.</p>
                <p>On the 21st the boats were again sent out, but to as little purpose as before.
                    Little trade was this day carried on, as the natives seemed very shy. But, On
                    the 22d, the ships having found anchorage on the south-west side, they were no
                    sooner moored than they were again surrounded with a more numerous multitude of
                    islanders than before, who seemed to express the greatest astonishment at the
                    greatness of our ships; nor did it appear that they had ever seen an European
                    ship before, though they were not wholly unacquainted with the use of iron. Most
                    of their canoes were laden with hogs, plantains, bananoes and sweet potatoes,
                    which they readily exchanged chiefly for iron. Here the sailors were suffered to
                    make what purchases they pleased; only women were prohibited by Capt. Cook's
                    order, on the severest penalties.—This caution, which was undoubtedly dictated
                    by humanity, to prevent the introduction of a loathsome disease among an
                    innocent people, <pb n="198"/> created a general murmur among the seamen, whose
                    pleasure was centered in that kind of commerce, in the new discovered islands,
                    wherever they went.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon the pinnace was ordered out, and the two Captains landed on the
                    beach, where they were met by the Chiefs of the island, and more than 2000 of
                    their subjects, not in a hostile manner, but in amity, exchanging presents, and
                    establishing trade.</p>
                <p>Capt. Cook made signs for water, and was conducted to a most delightful pool, so
                    conveniently situated for supplying the ships, that, had not the Resolution been
                    driven from her moorings by the violence of an easterly wind and strong current,
                    nothing could have exceeded our entertainment at this hospitable port. We met
                    with no obstruction in watering. These people merited our best commendations in
                    their commercial intercourse, never once attempting to cheat us, either ashore,
                    or along-side the ships. Some of them, indeed, at first betrayed a thievish
                    disposition; or rather they thought, that they had a right to every thing they
                    could lay their hands on; but we soon convinced them, that this conduct was not
                    to be suffered with impunity. One of our visitors, in the course of trade,
                    offered some fish-hooks to sell. He was observed to have a small parcel tied to
                    the string of one of them, which he separated with great care, and reserved for
                    himself. Being asked what it was, he pointed to his belly, and spoke something,
                    which we could not understand; at the same time saying it was bad, as if he did
                    not wish to answer any more questions about it. On seeing him so anxious to
                    conceal the contents, he was requested to open it, which he did with great
                    reluctance. They found that it contained a thin Page [unnumbered]
                    [illustration] [depiction of the people of the Sandwich Islands] A Man and Woman
                    of Sandwich Islands. p. 199. <pb n="199"/> bit of flesh, which to appearance had
                    been dried, but was now wet with salt water. It struck us that it might be human
                    flesh, and the question being put to him, he answered, that the flesh was part
                    of a man. Another of his countrymen, who stood by, was then asked, whether it
                    was their custom to eat those killed in battle, and he immediately answered in
                    the affirmative. Other proofs were not wanting to confirm this abominable
                    practice; and also that they, like the Otaheiteans, offered up human
                    sacrifices. We found, indeed, upon further acquaintance, such a similarity of
                    language, manners, customs, religious rites, and, in short, propensities of
                    disposition, as left us no room to doubt of their once having been one and the
                    same people. When the Resolution was forced to sea she had but half her
                    complement of water; nor had she fresh provisions sufficient to supply her
                    people for any length of time. We in the Discovery were more fortunate. In the
                    evening of the 24th we could see the Resolution to leeward eight or nine
                    leagues; and in the mean time, while she was beating up, we were employed in
                    compleating our hold.</p>
                <p>On the 24th, one of their great men paid a visit to Capt. Clerke. He came off in
                    a double canoe, and like the King of the Friendly Islands, paid no regard to the
                    small canoes that lay in her way, but run against them, or over them, without
                    endeavouring in the least to avoid them. His attendants helped him into the
                    ship, and placed him on the gangway, where they stood round him, holding each
                    other by the hands; nor would suffer any one to come near him, but Capt. Clerke
                    himself. He was a young man, clothed from head to foot, and accompanied by a
                    young woman, supposed to be his wife. His name was said <pb n="200"/> to be
                    Tamahano. Capt. Clerke made him some suitable presents, and received from him in
                    return, a large bowl, supported by two figures of men, the carving of which,
                    both as to design and execution, shewed some degree of skill. He could not be
                    prevailed upon to go below; but after staying some time in the ship, he was
                    carried again to his canoe, and returned to the island. The next day several
                    messages were received by Capt. Clerke, inviting him to return the visit; and
                    acquainting him, that the Chief had provided a large present on that occasion;
                    but being anxious to get to sea and join the Resolution, the Captain did not
                    think it adviseable to accept the invitation. This was the only Chief of note
                    seen upon this island.</p>
                <p>On the 25th we were in readiness to fail, and, having lost sight of the
                    Resolution, we imagined that, not being able to fetch her former station, she
                    had bore away to another island, which had been seen to the N. W. distance about
                    10 or 12 leagues.</p>
                <p>On the 26th we weighed, directing our course to the N. W. but about ten in the
                    morning, the man at the mast-head descried the Resolution at a great distance,
                    bearing S. by W. whereupon we instantly tacked, and stood S. by E. to join our
                    Commodore. This being effected, we remained several days beating up, but in
                    vain, to regain our former birth.</p>
                <p>On the 29th we bore away to another lee island, named Oneeheow, which abounded
                    with hogs and fruit, and where the natives were equally hospitable with those
                    we had just left, and brought from the shore every kind of provision their
                    country produced; but, there being no water to be procured at a moderate
                    distance, and the reefs being dangerous, and the surf running high, Capt. Page
                    [unnumbered] [illustration] [depiction of the people of the Sandwich Islands] A
                    Man of the Sandwich Islands in a Mask. page 200. <pb n="201"/> Cook, after
                    surveying the island, and taking possession of it, in the name of his Royal
                    Master, (calling the whole cluster Sandwich's Isles) was preparing to depart,
                    when a storm came on from the eastward, and again obliged the Resolution to put
                    to sea.</p>
                <p>The Captain had already exchanged several presents with the Chiefs of the island,
                    and had, in particular, presented a Chief with two she-goats and a ram; and had
                    received in return six large hogs, with a quantity of salt, an article which,
                    began to be much wanted. He had likewise purchased all such necessaries for
                    the ship's use, as the inhabitants could supply: and it was fortunate that he
                    had so done, before the storm came on; for afterwards it would have been
                    equally impossible for him to have recovered his station here, as he had found
                    it to regain his former birth in the other harbour. Our boats, while the shore
                    was accessible, were diligent in bringing on board the product of the island;
                    so that, on the evening of The 1st of February we had more than 250 hogs on
                    board, with salt in abundance, besides three months allowance of sweet potatoes,
                    bananoes, plantains, sugar-cane, and other provisions.</p>
                <p>Early in the morning on the 2d we weighed, and soon came in sight of the
                    Resolution; and both ships left the island to pursue the voyage.</p>
                <p>These islands, which lie between the latitude of 21.20. and 22.15. N. and long.
                    199.20. and 201.30. E. are not, in beauty and fertility, much inferior to the
                    Friendly Islands in the southern hemisphere, nor are the inhabitants less
                    ingenious or civilized. It is not a little astonishing, therefore, that they
                    should remain so long unknown to the Spaniards, as they lie, as it were, in the
                    midway between Manilla and the Western Coasts of New <pb n="202"/> Spain, and
                    will now probably be their rendezvous for refreshments. Except the first quarrel
                    that happened, of which we have already spoken, we had not the least difference
                    with any of the natives during our stay. What they had to dispose of they
                    parted with upon the easiest terms; nor did they seem quite so thievishly
                    inclined as those on the other side the line.</p>
                <p>Every island in this group, of which there are more than we could count, appeared
                    to be well peopled. In that which we first visited, called by the natives
                    Ottooi, it was no uncommon thing to see between two and three thousand of the
                    natives assemble on the beech, when any thing was to be shewn that excited their
                    curiosity. And there we learned the names of four other islands, viz. Woahoo,
                    Oneeheow, Oreehowe, and Tahoora; the last inhabited by birds, of which there
                    were, as we were told, incredible numbers.</p>
                <p>The men in these islands are of the middle size, of a dark complexion, not much
                    tattowed, but of a lively open countenance. They were no otherwise clothed than
                    decency required; and what they had on appeared to be their own manufacture, of
                    which there were various fabricks, and of a variety of colours. Some were made
                    with borders exactly resembling coverlets, and others appeared like printed
                    cottons; and, besides cloth, they had many other articles which shewed that they
                    had artificers among them not wanting in ingenuity. One peculiarity we observed
                    among the men, and that was, in the cut of their hair, which they trimmed up to
                    a ridge along their heads, in form like what, in horses manes, is called
                    hogging. Others again wore it long, plaiting it in tails, which hung below the
                    waist; and these we took for marks of distinction among them. Add to <pb n="203"
                    /> this, a kind of cap and short cloak worn by their Chiefs, in shape like those
                    worn by the Ladies in England, and composed of feathers of different colours,
                    ranged in rows, one over another, and narrowing from the lower border till they
                    terminated in a kind of net-work round the neck. The brilliant colours of the
                    feathers in those that happened to be new, added not a little to their fine
                    appearance; and we found that they were in great estimation with their owners,
                    for they would not at first part with one of them for any thing that we offered,
                    asking no less for each than a musket. However, some were afterwards purchased
                    for very large nails. The best sort was certainly scarce, and it should seem,
                    were only used at their theatrical exhibitions, or other solemnities. The cap is
                    made like a helmet, and sits very close, having notches to admit the ears. It
                    is a frame of twigs and osiers, covered with a net-work, into which are wrought
                    feathers, in the same manner as in the cloaks. These, with the cloaks, probably
                    compleat the theatrical dress.</p>
                <p>The women in general had shock hair, which they were at great pains to ornament.
                    They had large holes in their ears, that, filled as they were, with most
                    beautifully coloured shells made up in clusters, served for jewels, and had no
                    bad effect. Their head-dress consisted of wreaths of flowers, decorated with
                    feathers chiefly red; and having, in general, lively piercing black eyes, white
                    teeth, small features, and round faces, were not a little inviting, had not
                    Chpt. Cook's severe prohibition put a check to the predominant passion of our
                    men.</p>
                <p>Their dress, upon the whole, was more decent than that of the men; and few were
                    without necklaces and bracelets, of which they seemed very fond, and for which
                    our strings of beads were well <pb n="204"/> suited. To their necklaces were
                    sometimes seen small human figures of bone, hung pendant.</p>
                <p>Their language differed but little from that of every other people we had lately
                    visited; and we soon learnt to converse, so as to make ourselves understood.</p>
                <p>Their manufactures the people freely sold for nails, hatchets, scissars, knives,
                    or iron instruments of any kind; glass bowls was a valuable article; so were
                    beads, buttons, looking-glasses, china-cups, and in short, any of our European
                    commodities.</p>
                <p>Their weapons of war consisted—Of spears twelve feet long, curiously polished,
                    and tapered; about an inch and half in diameter at top, and shod with bearded
                    bone, about a foot in length at the lower end—Of daggers of a particular make,
                    with which they could stab with both ends—Of bows and arrows, which seemed
                    rather calculated for diversion for boys, than for killing enemies; their arrows
                    being a slender reed, only about half a yard long, shod with wood—Of small
                    battle-axes, most ingeniously fabricated of stone and wood, and neatly wrought,
                    as were their implements of every kind—Of saws made of sharks teeth, with which
                    they cut up the dead bodies they prepare for meat—And of slings, with which they
                    threw stones with great force, to a great distance, but with no certain aim.</p>
                <p>Their canoes were long and narrow; not more than two feet wide in the middle,
                    from whence they tapered to both ends. They were strengthened by cross bars,
                    which served both for feats and stretchers, and had small out-riggers, to
                    prevent over-setting.</p>
                <p>That they had some knowledge of iron before we landed among them is certain; but
                    how they <pb n="205"/> came by it is not clearly to be accounted for; the most
                    probable conjecture is, that it must have been drifted to their coast from some
                    wrecks; and that opinion is strengthened, by part of an iron hoop being the only
                    precious remains of that metal that was seen among them, which was purchased by
                    Lieut. King. But from this small specimen, how to learn the use of it, which
                    they certainly did, by their eagerness to purchase it? This remains to be
                    accounted for.</p>
                <p>Except the sugar-cane, which appeared indigenous to these islands, and which
                    were rare in those on the other side the line, their produce was much the same
                    with that of the Friendly Isles, only the cocoa-nuts were by no means so large,
                    nor in such great plenty here as at the Friendly Isles.</p>
                <p>Wood was not to be purchased in plenty, nor did we stand much in need of that
                    article.</p>
                <p>Hogs, dogs, ducks, and poultry, were here in greater abundance than on the other
                    side the line; but their plantations were not so beautifully ranged, nor so well
                    cultivated. The houses here are warmer, as the air is colder. They are built
                    tent-fashion, and are covered from top to bottom. Their food consists of the
                    fruits of the earth, and of animal food, of which there was great plenty, if
                    dogs made a part of it; nor was there any want of fish, nor of instruments to
                    catch them.</p>
                <p>There seems, indeed, a remarkable conformity between these islands and those of
                    the opposite hemisphere, not only in their situations, but in their number, and
                    in their manners, customs, religious, ceremonies, arts, and manufactures of the
                    inhabitants; though it can scarce be imagined, that, as the globe is now
                    constituted, they could ever have any communication, being at more than 2000 <pb
                        n="206"/> miles distance one from the other, with very little, if any, dry
                    land between. One custom remarkable, they seem to have in common with the New
                    Zealanders; and that is, pulling out one of their teeth.</p>
                <p>From observing this general conformity among the tropical islanders, some have
                    been led to believe, that the whole middle region of the earth was once one
                    entire continent; and that what is now the Great South Pacific Ocean, was, in
                    the beginning, the Paradise of the World: but whoever would wish to hear more
                    on this subject, will do well to read Burnet's Theory of the Earth, where, if
                    they do not find arguments solid enough to convince their reason, they will meet
                    with reasons sufficiently plausible to amuse their fancy. But we must now take
                    leave of these islands, tho' we shall have occasion to mention them again with
                    less commendation.</p>
                <p>Capt. Cook, the short time he remained at Atooi, visited the morais on the
                    island, which formerly had been most magnificent structures, but were now much
                    in decay, but still preserved all the appearances of human sacrifices; of which
                    there is not a doubt, any more than of their eating the flesh of their enemies,
                    which they call savoury meat.</p>
                <p>On the 3d of February, the day after we took our departure, we had heavy squalls,
                    but not so violent as to force us to part company.</p>
                <p>On the 4th, it cleared up, and we pursued our course E. N. E. having pleasant
                    weather, and a favouring gale.</p>
                <p>On the 5th, our men had pickled pork served instead of their ordinary allowance,
                    one pound per man a-day, with a pound and a half of yams, instead of bread; and
                    this was continued to them <pb n="207"/> for seven weeks, which they liked much
                    better than their ship's provisions.</p>
                <p>Nothing material occurred till The 9th, when there appeared the usual signs of
                    land, but we saw none, and continued our course till The 13th, when we tacked
                    and stood N. N. W. lat. 30. long. 200. E. But, On the 14th, we stood again N. by
                    E. with a light breeze. During this interval of fine weather, our sail-makers
                    were employed in getting up and reviewing the sails, when it was found that they
                    were in a miserable condition, being eaten through by the rats in a hundred
                    places. While they were employed in repairing them, our other artificers had
                    work enough to do; for it was made a point to suffer none to remain idle, when
                    the business of navigating the ship did not require their immediate attendance.
                    The course we were now steering we continued with little or no variation, except
                    what was occasioned by the shifting of the winds, till the 21st, when in lat.
                    39. long. 209. E. we shorttened sail, and steered N. N. W. the whole night,
                    having had strong signs of land to the Eastward the whole day; but no land
                    coming in sight, we again renewed our course, and so continued till The 26th,
                    when a most dreadful storm arose, with such a swell, that though we were not
                    more than half a mile from the Resolution, we frequently lost sight of her
                    amidst the heavy seas. In this gale, both ships suffered considerably in their
                    sails and rigging, it being impossible to hand them before we were surprised by
                    the tempest. We were now in lat. 43.17. and in long. 221.9. and were attended by
                    seals, sea-lions, man-of-war birds, Port Egmont hens, shags, and sea-gulls,
                    which were strong indications of land.</p>
                <pb n="208"/>
                <p>On the morning of the 27th, the wind abated but the swell still continued from
                    the Southward and we proceeded under close reefed top-sails til about ten in the
                    morning, when we shook out the reefs, and made all the sail we could, in company
                    with the Resolution.</p>
                <p>March the 1st, the wind died away, and being in lat. 44.49. and long. 228. E. we
                    sounded with 180 fathom, but found no bottom. We now began to feel the effects
                    of an alteration in the climate. From intense heat, it became piercing cold;
                    and our men, who despised their Magellan jackets, while within the temperate
                    climates, now first began to find the comfort of them in these Northern
                    regions.</p>
                <p>On the morning of the 2d, some parts of the sea seemed covered with a kind of
                    slime, and myriads of small sea animals were seen swimming about, which they
                    did with equal ease upon their backs, sides, or bellies; and as they varied
                    their position with respect to the light, they emitted the brightest colours of
                    the most precious gems. Sometimes they appeared quite pellucid, at other times
                    assuming various tints of blue, from a pale sappharine to a deep violet colour,
                    which were frequently mixed with a ruby or opaline redness, and glowed with a
                    strength sufficient to illuminate the vessel and water; these colours appeared
                    most vivid, when the glass into which these animalcula were placed, was held to
                    a strong light, but had only a brownish cast when the animals had subsided to
                    the bottom. With candle-light, the colour was chiefly a beautiful pale green;
                    and in the dark they had a faint appearance of glowing fire. Mr. Anderson
                    supposed them a new species of animalcula, which have a share in producing that
                        <pb n="209"/> lucid appearance often observed near ships at sea in the
                    night.</p>
                <p>On the 5th, being moderate weather, we sounded, and at 56 fathoms found bottom,
                    loamy sand and shells. At six in the evening, we shortened sail, and stood all
                    night S. one half W. with the water as white as milk.</p>
                <p>On the 6th, both ships wore and stood N. by E. shortening sail in the evening,
                    and standing all night to the Southward.</p>
                <p>On the 7th, we made the land. Cape Blanco, the Westernmost known point of
                    California, bearing E. N. E. then distant about 8 or 9 leagues. It appeared
                    mountainous, and covered with snow. This day the gentlemen in the gun-room dined
                    on a fricassee of rats, which they accounted a venison feast; and it was a high
                    treat to the sailors, whenever they could be lucky enough to catch a number
                    sufficient to make a meal.</p>
                <p>On the 8th, we wore ship, and stood N. E. by E. lat. 44.23. long. 233.5. E. We
                    had heavy squalls, with snow and rain. We continued working off land, making
                    little or no way to windward. In the evening, we close reefed our top-sails,
                    and within half an hour could not shew an inch of sail, except fore and mizen
                    stay-sails. The storm continued all night, and part of the next day, without the
                    least abatement.</p>
                <p>Early in the morning of the 9th, saw the Resolution to windward, and at eight
                    came in sight of Cape Blanco, bearing N. by W. distant about three leagues. At
                    ten tacked ship, and stood off land, both ships in company, lat. 43.10. long.
                    232.4. E.</p>
                <p>On the 10th, both ships stood again for the land, which we could see at a great
                    distance. At six in the evening, the land being distant about a <pb n="210"/>
                    league, we wore ship, and stood off all night, Lost sight of the Resolution,
                    lat. 43.41. long. 232.50.</p>
                <p>On the 11th, she answered our signals, and we were soon in company; but the sea
                    running mountains high, and the wind increasing a strong gale, we stood N. by E.
                    the wind at E. by N. and about two in the afternoon, the Cape bore N. E. by E.
                    distant about six leagues. Here the wind being somewhat abated, and the sea
                    having changed its colour, we sounded at 160 fathom, but no bottom. Both ships
                    stood again W. S. W. all night with little wind, but great swells from the
                    Eastward, lat. 43.39. long. 231.19.</p>
                <p>On the 12th, light winds, which continued all the morning with snow and sleet. At
                    two in the afternoon, both ships stood S. by W. with a stiff breeze. At six wore
                    ship, and stood N. wind E. N. E. At ten, course N. N. E. wind W. by S. and so
                    continued all night, lat. 43.2. long. 231.57.</p>
                <p>On the 13th, about eight in the morning, we wore ship, and stood W. by S. heavy
                    rain, and snow. At noon split the mizen top-mast stay-sail. At night, course W.
                    S. W. wind variable. Lat. 43.32. long. 230.52.</p>
                <p>On the 14th, at six in the morning, wore ship, and stood N. by E. wind N. W. by
                    W. Strong gale, with snow and rain. About three in the afternoon, the wind
                    abated. Stood for the land, then distant 6 or 7 leagues, bearing N. E. by E.
                    lat. 43.9. long. 231.55.</p>
                <p>On the 15th, wore ship, and stood N. half W. the wind E. N. E. all the morning.
                    In the afternoon, heavy squalls, with rain. About four, split the main
                    top-sail. At six, close reefed the top-sails, and stood all night N. N. E. with
                    heavy <pb n="211"/> rains, and a strong gale. Till this day, the yams on board
                    our ship lasted; but now bread was delivered out to the ship's company in their
                    stead, at two-thirds allowance. All well, and in perfect health, notwithstanding
                    the severe service. Lat. 43.9. long. 229.34.</p>
                <p>On the 16th, it cleared up, and the wind being moderate, we made sail N. ½ E. the
                    wind at W. S. W. At ten in the morning, finding the water to change colour, we
                    sounded at 17 fathom, and looking a-head, saw a large reef, not above two cables
                    length before us. We fired a gun as signal to the Resolution, and had just time
                    and room to escape the danger. Had it been night, in two minutes we must all
                    have perished. We tacked, and stood to the Southward till the morning of The
                    17th, when we came in sight of land, bearing N. E. by E. distance eight or nine
                    leagues, high, and whited over with snow. The weather was this day so altered,
                    that the gentlemen who delighted in the sport, diverted themselves in the boats
                    with shooting ducks, shags, sea-larks, and gulls; and next morning, The 18th, we
                    continued to steer along shore, the land not more than three miles distant; saw
                    no inhabitants, but very large trees, and bleak mountains covered with snow.
                    About twelve at noon we hauled upon a wind, and stood W. by N. wind S. W. by S.
                    As we found the coast rugged with high rocks above water, we suspected other
                    rocks below. We therefore kept at a convenient distance from the land, and
                    opened upon several fine inlets and close harbours, but no entrance for ships
                    of burden. Lat. 44.49. long. 231.50.</p>
                <p>On the 19th, made sail early in the morning, and stood N. N. E. coasting it along
                    shore, the <pb n="212"/> land high and mountainous. We heard howlings of wild
                    beasts, but saw none. The shores were covered with sea-fowl, and the skirts of
                    the woods with land birds of various kinds.</p>
                <p>On the 20th, the weather still continuing fine, we pursued our course N. N. E.
                    with light winds from the S. E. till two in the afternoon, when the clouds began
                    to darken, and the rain pour down in torrents. At five it blew a stiff gale, and
                    at night a fog arose, when we soon lost sight of the Resolution. At ten it blew
                    a hurricane. We close reefed our top-sails, lowered our top-gallant yards, and
                    stood W. S. W. wind S. firing guns, and hoisting lights as signals to the
                    Resolution; but not being answered, we lay to till morning, with the ship's head
                    to the South, lat. 45.22. long. 231.42.</p>
                <p>On the 21st, as soon as it was day-light, we saw the Resolution bearing N. N. W.
                    distant about four miles. We made sail, and soon came up with her: the wind
                    abating, we pursued our course N. one-half W. and before noon, lost sight of
                    land, as it trended to the East. About four in the afternoon, the weather
                    altered, and a heavy snow came on, which soon filled the decks, the flakes being
                    such as no man on board had ever seen before, and as broad as a small saucer.
                    Before it was dark it turned to rain, and so continued with gusts of wind
                    during the night.</p>
                <p>On the 22d, we came again in sight of land, bearing N. by E. distant about five
                    or six leagues, covered with snow, and abounding with trees of an immense
                    height; as we neared it, we observed several smokes far up the country; but
                    before we reached the shore, a sudden storm came on, more violent than any we
                    had yet met with on this tempestuous coast. Before we had time to hand <pb
                        n="213"/> the sails, it split the jib, carred away the stay, and shivered
                    the main top-mast stay-sails to fritters. As night approached, we furled the
                    courses and lay too under bare poles.</p>
                <p>On the 23d in the morning the wind abated, and the weather cleared up. We made
                    sail to the Southward; but before dark it again began to blow with heavy rain.
                    We stood all night with the ship's head S. one-half W. with starboard tacks on
                    board. No observation.</p>
                <p>On the 24th we tacked ship and stood N. N. E. the wind at N. W. by N. a steady
                    breeze; we shook out our reefs and made sail. Such and so variable was the
                    weather on Drake's New Albion coast. From a hard gale, which increased to a
                    hurricane, not being able to shew an inch of sail for several hours, the sea
                    running to a tremendous height, the ship rolling till the yard-arms almost
                    reached the water, it all at once cleared up, moderate and fine gales took
                    place, and so continued the whole day. We were now by observation in lat. 47.25.
                    long. 230.1. As night approached the clouds began to lour, and to threaten
                    another storm: but except some snow and hail which fell in the night, nothing
                    remarkable happened till The 25th, when a thick fog arose, and we lost sight of
                    the Resolution; but before night we were again in company. About six in the
                    evening it came on to blow hard with heavy showers; we wore ship and stood to
                    the Southward, the rain continuing the whole night.</p>
                <p>On the 26th, at five in the morning, we had a heavy fall of snow, which lasted
                    four hours, with piercing winds the whole day. About ten we bore away, and stood
                    N. N. W. the wind at N. E. In the evening we tacked ship and <pb n="214"/> stood
                    to the Southward. We were now in lat. 48.28. long. 228.40.</p>
                <p>On the 27th, at six in the morning, stood W. by N. with a stiff breeze. At ten it
                    became very heavy and dark. We stood N. by E. the wind shifted to E. by N. and a
                    calm succeeded. But about six in the evening the wind freshened, and before we
                    could hand the canvas, split the fore-top-sail.</p>
                <p>Early on the 28th, it blowing very hard, we close-reefed our top-sails, and stood
                    N. N. E. the wind at E. This day we saw three men of war birds, two Port Egmont
                    hens, several seals, and sea-lions, with some whales. Lat. 49.6. long.
                    228.18.</p>
                <p>On the 29th, at two in the morning, it still continued to blow very hard. We
                    tacked, and stood S. S. W. till seven in the morning, when the weather cleared
                    up, and the wind rather abated. We shook out our reefs, and made sail N. by E.
                    with a light breeze from E. by N. At ten the man at the mast-head saw land,
                    bearing from E. S. E. to W. N. W. distance five or six leagues. At half after
                    one, P. M. we bore away N. E. by E. for a bay, which we thought we saw to the
                    Eastward. As we approached it, we observed several smokes and fires a
                    considerable way within land. At length, after a series of the most tempestuous
                    weather that any ships ever experienced for so long a time, we discovered an
                    inlet, the mouth of which was not more than two miles over; in which we entered,
                    and found it a sound, which narrowed as we advanced, though it still continued
                    of a considerable depth. About seven in the evening we anchored in ninety-seven
                    fathom water, and was presently joined by the Resolution. We made signs for <pb
                        n="215"/> some of the natives to come on board; but this they declined,
                    though some hundreds soon came about the ships, to which they appeared to be no
                    strangers, as they give us to understand, that iron was what they valued most.
                    We observed likewise, that their weapons were headed with copper, and their
                    arrows with iron, which they could obtain only from the Russians, or from trade
                    with the Hudson's Bay Company. Though they declined coming on board, they were
                    nevertheless very civil; and when they took their leave, saluted us with a
                    war-song. We were now so far advanced to the Northward and Eastward, as to have
                    reached that void space in our maps, which is marked as a country unknown.</p>
                <p>Early in the morning of the 30th, the boats were armed and manned, and both
                    Captains proceeded to examine the Sound, in order to find a convenient place to
                    refit the ships, which had suffered materially in the violent gales, which for
                    the last twenty days they had been combating, at the hazard of being hourly
                    dashed to pieces upon the rocks, or stranded upon the shores.</p>
                <p>In their progress they were fortunate enough to discover a cove, the most
                    convenient that could be wished; the entrance of which was about two cables
                    length, bounded by high land on each side, and furnished with wood and water
                    (now much wanted) so conveniently situated, that both could be taken on board at
                    less than a cable's length from the shore; but, though now within the distance
                    of four miles, it was four o'clock in the evening before we could get the ships
                    properly moored, owing to the uncertainty of the weather, and the violent gusts
                    to which this coast is subject. All this while the Indians behaved peaceably,
                    and apparently with much <pb n="216"/> friendship. They brought, after a short
                    acquaintance, a great variety of valuable skins, such as beaver, foxes,
                    racoons, squirrels, reindeer, bears, and several others, with which we were but
                    little acquainted; but what they chiefly desired in exchange, were cutlery wares
                    of all sorts, edge-tools, copper, pewter, iron, brass, or any kind of metal,
                    with the use of which they were not unacquainted. All our people were now
                    employed in the necessary repairs of the ships, and in cutting wood and getting
                    water on board, while the gentlemen diverted themselves in shooting and
                    botanizing.</p>
                <p>On the 1st of April, about four in the evening, there entered the cove a large
                    canoe, in which were thirty armed Indians, who, on their first appearance, began
                    a war-song, and when they had finished, took to their paddles, and rowed round
                    the ships, having first stript themselves of their clothing, except one man,
                    who stood upright in the vessel, delivering an oration, of which not a man on
                    board could understand a word. They paddled round the ships several times, as if
                    led by curiosity; but did not offer to molest any of the workmen, nor did they
                    offer to trade. But all hands being instantly ordered under arms, these new
                    visitors were seen to clothe themselves as before, and to make towards the
                    ships. The Orator made not the least hesitation, but mounted the ship's side,
                    and accosted the Captain with much civility, and after receiving some presents,
                    and stopping a little while to observe the artificers, he took a very polite
                    leave, descended to his boat, and was landed on the opposite shore of the
                    Sound.</p>
                <p>On the 3d, a large body of Indians were seen paddling along the Sound, mostly
                    armed with <pb n="217"/> spears from 20 to 30 feet long, and with bows and
                    arrows very neatly made. On their nearer approach they too were heard to tune up
                    their war-song, and to brandish their weapons, as if in defiance of an enemy.
                    Their number was alarming; there being not less than between 3 and 400 of them
                    in their war canoes, who we apprehended were come to attack us; but we
                    afterwards understood they were come to attack a body of their enemies on the
                    opposite shore, whom they afterwards engaged, and returned victorious. We were
                    frequently visited by such parties, who appeared always in arms, but never
                    offered the least violence. They brought, besides skins, great quantities of
                    fish, with plenty of game, which we purchased of them for glass bowls,
                    looking-glasses, nails, hatchets, or whatever utensils or toys were either
                    useful or ornamental.</p>
                <p>The men were of an athletic make, very rough to appearance, but more civilized
                    than from their aspect there was reason to expect. To iron they gave the name of
                    te-tum-miné, and to other metals ché-à-poté.</p>
                <p> On the 5th, the water, which was excellent, was so conveniently situated, that
                    by erecting a stage, and constructing a spout, we could convey it in casks into
                    the ships without farther trouble. This facilitated the labour of the waterers,
                    and shortened our stay, as wood was conveyed on board with very little more
                    trouble.</p>
                <p>On the 6th it blew a storm, and the tide came rolling in at an alarming rate; it
                    presently rose eight or nine feet higher than usual, and drifted several of our
                    materials from the shore, which we never could recover; and at nine in the
                    morning the Discovery drifted very near the Resolution, and very narrowly
                    escaped being bulged.</p>
                <pb n="218"/>
                <p>On the 7th, the artificers again resumed their labour. The natives continued
                    their visits, and besides fish, furs, and venison, brought bladders of oil,
                    which were greedily purchased by the men. With this they made sauce for their
                    salt-fish, and no butter in England was ever thought half so good.</p>
                <p>During our stay here, which was but very short, owing to the time lost in making
                    the land, and the advanced season of the year, no people could be more obliging;
                    they were ready to accompany the gentlemen, who delighted in shooting, in their
                    excursions, and to shew them the different devices they made use of to catch
                    and to kill their game; they sold them their masks, their calls, and their gins,
                    and made no secret of their methods of curing the skins, with which they
                    carried on a traffic with occasional visitors; in short, a more open and
                    communicative people does not live under the sun. They have, besides sea-fowl in
                    abundance, swans, eagles, and a variety of other land-fowl, of which we had
                    never seen the species. Nor were their fishermen more reserved than their
                    hunters; they pointed out the haunts of the different sorts of fish, and they
                    were not averse to helping their new acquaintance to compleat their lading,
                    whenever they had been unsuccessful in filling their boats.</p>
                <p>They had not hitherto discovered any disposition to pilfer; but on the 10th day,
                    after our arrival, several of them being on board, and our people having no
                    suspicion of their honesty, one of them watched his opportunity to slip into the
                    great cabin, and carry off the Captain's watch; which being soon missed, all the
                    Indians on board were seized, their boats secured and searched; and at length it
                    was found hid in a box on board <pb n="219"/> one of their canoes, which the
                    offender delivered up without the least concern. This watch, had the thief been
                    permitted to carry it off, would probably have been parted with to the first
                    sailor he had met with for a single nail. About the same time another Indian
                    made free with a bolt from the armourer's forge; but was seen in the fact, and
                    an endeavour made to wrest it from him; but he instantly jumped over-board, and
                    gave it to one of his companions, who was making off with it, till fired at with
                    small shot, which brought him back; and he surrendered it, but with such a
                    fierceness expressed in his countenance, as sufficiently indicated his intent.
                    In a moment, every Indian in the cove disappeared, and in less than three hours
                    more than 900 of them assembled in the Sound, and being unclothed, (which is
                    their custom when they mean to engage) began their war-song, and approached the
                    ships. We were in readiness to give them a warm reception; but seeing our
                    preparations, and perhaps not liking our countenance, they all laid down their
                    arms, and putting on their clothes, came peaceably round the ship, without
                    offering the least incivility.</p>
                <p>Being in great want of masts, most of those we brought out with us being sprung,
                    our carpenters were sent into the woods to cut down such trees as they should
                    find fit for their purpose. This they did without the least interruption from
                    any of the inhabitants. They found trees from 100 to 150 feet high, without a
                    knot, and measuring from 40 to 60 feet in circumference. In these trees the
                    eagles build their nests. When they had cut down what best suited their purpose,
                    the great difficulty was to bring them to the ships; and in this labour they
                    were assisted by the natives. It was now their spring, and <pb n="220"/> the
                    weather began to change for the better. When we first arrived the thermometer
                    was as low as 38½, and now This 20th day of April it is as high as 62 degrees.
                    We have at present the full range of the woods, the snow all melted away, and
                    the rivers open. We found plenty of game, and catched fish in abundance.</p>
                <p>April 22. This morning we were visited by a large body of Indians, who had come
                    from a great distance with furs, and other articles of trade. These were warmly
                    clothed with cloaks of valuable furs, that reached down to their ancles; and
                    among them was a stately youth, to whom the rest paid great respect. Him our
                    Captain invited on board, which he at first declined; but after shewing him
                    some axes, glass bowls, looking-glasses, and other articles that excited his
                    curiosity, he suffered himself to be handed into the ship, where he staid some
                    time, admiring every thing he saw. While these continued to trade, it was
                    remarked, that no other Indians came in sight; but they had hardly left the
                    ship, when another body of Indians appeared, more than double the number of the
                    former, who hemmed them all into the cove, and stript them of every thing they
                    had about them, and then came and traded with us.</p>
                <p>At the same time a chief, who had attached himself to Capt. Cook, came on board
                    to take his leave, and received a present, for which in return he presented a
                    beaver-skin of much greater value. This called upon the Captain to make a
                    considerable addition to his present, with which the chief was so pleased, that
                    he pulled off his beaver-skin cloak, and laid it at his feet. Struck with this
                    instance of generosity, the Captain fetched him a <pb n="221"/> new broad sword
                    with a brass-hilt, which made this chief compleatly happy.</p>
                <p>On the 26th, having finished the repairs of the ships, we began to prepare for
                    our departure; the tents were ordered to be brought on board, the astronomers
                    observatory, and what live-stock we had yet left; and as the last service to be
                    performed, we cut grass for their subsistence, which we were fortunate enough
                    to find in plenty, and to have a pretty good time to make it into hay. We also,
                    by the assistance of Mr. Nelson, whose business, as has already been observed,
                    was to collect the vegetable and other curious productions of the countries
                    through which we passed, were enabled to stock ourselves with a large
                    proportion of culinary plants, which was of infinite service to us in our more
                    northerly progress. And now having all things in readiness we began to tow out
                    of the cove into the Sound, to which Capt. Cook gave the name of King George's
                    Sound, and with a light breeze and clear weather to proceed on our voyage: but
                    we had scarce reached the Sound, when a violent gust from E. S. E. threw us into
                    the utmost confusion. All our boats were out, our decks full of lumber, and
                    night coming on dark and foggy, our danger was equal to any we had hitherto met
                    with in the course of the voyage; though an especial Providence seemed to attend
                    us, and to interpose in our favour: for by this storm a leak was discovered in
                    the Resolution, which, had it been calm weather, would probably have proved
                    fatal to the crew. Having cleared the Sound, we shaped our course to the
                    Westward, and so continued till day-light, when, seeing nothing of the
                    Resolution, we shortened sail; and before noon she came in sight, seemingly in
                    distress. The storm continuing, <pb n="222"/> we pursued our course to the
                    North-westward, till May 1st, when the weather became fair, and we proceeded
                    with a pleasant breeze. Being now at leisure to recollect what observations
                    occurred at the harbour we have just left, the curious reader will not be
                    displeased with a short relation. When we first arrived in the Sound, the rough
                    countenance of the men seemed to promise no very agreeable entertainment during
                    our stay; but when they saw our distress, and that we only meant to repair our
                    ships, so far from giving us any disturbance, they gave us every assistance in
                    their power. They supplied us regularly with fish; and, when they found that our
                    men liked their oil, they brought it in bladders, and exchanged it for whatever
                    they were pleased to give in return. They discovered no propensity to thieve,
                    till they found we were preparing to depart, and then they were so covetous of
                    our goods, that they could not resist the temptation, when a fair opportunity
                    offered, to carry off whatever fell in their way.</p>
                <p>The cove, in which we anchored, we found to lie in 49 deg. 33 min. N. and in 233
                    deg. 16 min. E. but whether the Ruffian discoveries had reached so far, we
                    could not be able to determine: that the inhabitants were no strangers to the
                    use of iron and other metals was, as has already been observed, visible on our
                    first approach; but by their manner of using what they possessed, it was not
                    easy to discover from what quarter it came. In the situation we were in, we did
                    not think it safe to venture far into the country, having no spare hands to
                    attend us. Of their houses we saw but few; and of their manner of living we know
                    but little. That they eat the Page [unnumbered] [illustration] [depiction of the
                    people of the Soolka Sound] A Man and Woman of Soolka Sound. p. 223. 224. <pb
                        n="223"/> flesh of their enemies, we had some reason to suppose, by
                    observing a human head in one of their canoes, and arms and limbs in another;
                    but that fish, and the flesh of the animals they catch in hunting, are the
                    principal part of their food, is not to be doubted. Their bread is made from the
                    roes of fish, but in what manner they prepare it, we could not learn; their
                    sauces chiefly sea-blubber or oil. We saw none of their houses near the shore,
                    by which it should seem that their winters are severe, and that they chuse the
                    recesses of the woods, for shelter as well as safety. The few houses we saw were
                    all built of wood, and hung round with dried fish, and skins of various animals.
                    They have different masks for different purposes; some they put on when they go
                    to war, which are really frightful; some that cover their whole bodies, and give
                    them the appearance of the animals they are in pursuit of, whose cries, while,
                    they are young, they are taught to imitate; they have decoys excellently adapted
                    for entrapping both fish and fowl; and they have snares likewise for snaring
                    wild beasts, and contrivances for killing and curing them as soon as they are
                    catched.</p>
                <p>We saw no plantations which exhibited the least trace of knowledge in the
                    cultivation of the earth; all seemed to remain in a pure state of nature;
                    shrubs there were in the woods that put forth blossoms, and trees that promised
                    in time to bring forth fruit; but except some currant bushes, wild rasberries
                    and junipers, we saw none bearing fruit that were known to any but Mr.
                    Nelson.</p>
                <p>The men were not ill made, but they disfigured themselves with grease and coarse
                    paint; they were of a dark copper-colour, with lank black <pb n="224"/> hair,
                    which they tied in a knot behind; but they so bepowdered, or rather befeathered
                    it with down, that the colour was hardly discernible: their clothing was a cloak
                    made of skins of beasts, which covered them from the neck to their knees, and
                    gave them a savage appearance; some of them wore high fur caps, but the Chiefs
                    among them had their heads dressed in a more becoming manner. In that consisted
                    their chief distinction. Their heads were bound round with fillets, decorated
                    with feathers, which adds so striking a grace to the human figure, that almost
                    every nation in the known world have agreed in making plumes of feathers a part
                    of their warriors uniform. Their weapons of war were spears from 20 to 30 feet
                    long; their bows about three feet and a half; their arrows two feet, pointed
                    with bone or flint, some few with iron; but they had one horrid weapon peculiar
                    to themselves, resembling a man's head with hair; it had eyes and nose, but
                    where the mouth should be, a sharp piece of bone or flint about six inches long
                    was firmly mortised and cemented; in the neck part was a hole, through which
                    they passed a strong cord, and fastened it to the right arm; this we saw none of
                    the warriors without; many of them had besides, a knife about twelve inches
                    long, of which they were very choice. We saw no musical instruments among them;
                    but some had musical voices, and seemed fond of dancing and tumbling in a
                    bearish way. Their canoes were of an uncommon length, many of them from 30 to 40
                    yards long, made of the main body of one of their enormous trees, of which we
                    have already spoken; their breadth from four to five feet over in the middle,
                    and gradually narrowing, like all others, to both ends, but the stem much higher
                    than the stern. They were <pb n="225"/> strengthened by bars of wood, or
                    stretchers, placed across at certain distances, and were rowed by paddles about
                    six feet long, swelling from the middle, but sharp at the lower ends. Some of
                    those canoes were roughly carved and painted with the figures of the sun, moon,
                    and stars, probably the objects of their worship; but what was remarkable, they
                    had no out-riggers to prevent their oversetting, like those of the southern
                    isles.</p>
                <p>The women are much more delicate than the men, and dress in cloaks curiously
                    woven with the hair of wild beasts, intermixed with the most beautiful furs. We
                    saw but few of them during our stay, and those who came in sight were rather in
                    years; they were, however, much fairer than the men; and even fairer than many
                    of the men we had on board. Their employment seems chiefly confined at home. We
                    saw none of them employed in fishing, nor did we meet any of them in the woods.
                    Besides the care of their children, and the manufacturing and making the
                    clothing, they may probably assist in curing and preparing the skins, with which
                    these people certainly carry on a traffic with strangers; though of that trade,
                    for want of understanding their language, we could not sufficiently inform
                    ourselves. Be that as it may, when we left the harbour, we had more than 300
                    beaver skins on board, besides other less valuable skins, of foxes, racoons,
                    wolves, bears, deer, and several other wild animals; for dogs excepted, we saw
                    no other domestic creatures about them.</p>
                <p>On May the 1st, in the morning, the weather being fine, we spoke with the
                    Resolution, who informed us of the danger they were in of foundering in the
                    late gale, by a leak, which increased so fast upon them, that it baffled the
                    utmost efforts <pb n="226"/> of all the hands they had on board; gaining upon
                    them considerably, though every man in the ship, even to the Captain, took it in
                    turn to work at the pumps; but what was astonishing, it had now stopt of itself,
                    without the carpenter's being able to discover either the cause or the cure.
                    However, Capt. Cook gave us to understand, that he intended to put in at the
                    first harbour he should fall in with.</p>
                <p>We were now in high spirits, not dreaming of the hardships we had yet to suffer,
                    and we pursued our course at a great rate. Before night we were in lat. 54.44.
                    N. and in long. 224.44. E. with whole flocks of sea-fowl flying over our heads;
                    among which were strings of geese and swans, all flying to the southward. We had
                    other indications of land, and on The 2d we came in sight of a high mountain,
                    being then in lat. 57.3. and in long. 224.7. E. This mountain Capt. Cook named
                    Mount Edgecomb.</p>
                <p>On the 3d, at half an hour after four in the morning, Mount Edgecomb, bore S. 54.
                    E. a large inlet N. 50. E. distant six leagues; and the most advanced point of
                    the land to the N. W. lying under a very high peeked mountain, which obtained
                    the name of Mount Fair Weather, bore N. 52. W. This inlet was called Cross
                    Sound, as being first seen on that day, so marked in our calendar. At noon the
                    lat. was 58.22. and the long. 220.55. We continued our course to the
                    north-westward as the land trended, till the 10th, when we opened on a very high
                    island, to which Capt. Cook gave the name of Kaye Island, in honour of his
                    friend the Rev. Dr. Kaye, Subalmoner to his Majesty. A point shoots out from
                    the main towards this island, to which the Captain <pb n="227"/> gave the name
                    of Cape Suckling. This island, on examination, was found barren, and destitute
                    of inhabitants. This we left to the southward, and continued our course, in
                    hopes of discovering some harbour where the Resolution might examine her leaks.
                    We were now in lat. 59.51. and in long. 215.56. the land high and mountainous,
                    and covered with snow. At four in the afternoon, we came in sight of Cape Elias,
                    a vast promontory, that seemed to cover its head in the clouds. It bore from us
                    S. ½ W.</p>
                <p>On the 11th we had a flask calm, which lasted for the space of four hours, during
                    which all hands were employed, officers as well as men, in fishing, shooting, or
                    chasing the seals, and sea-lions that played about the ships. Great quantities
                    of fine cod were caught, which furnished a high treat to both ships companies;
                    and some docks, sea-larks, and four sea-parrots, were killed by the fowlers. In
                    the evening a fresh breeze sprang up, and we coasted along shore, but saw no
                    inhabitants, though many fires were observed in the night within land. In our
                    course we passed a bay, named by Capt. Cook Comptrollers Bay. Lat. 60.15. long.
                    215.15.</p>
                <p>On the 12th we hauled up to double a cape, to which our Commodore gave the name
                    of Cape Hinchinbroke, and saw the land trending very much to the northward.
                    About 3, A. M. we tacked, steering N. N. W. and at nine in the morning, opened a
                    large strait, the entrance of which appeared to be about four miles. About four
                    in the afternoon we entered the mouth of the strait, and met a strong current
                    that set to the southward to oppose our progress; having a stiff breeze, and the
                    wind much in our favour, we with difficulty stemmed the tide, and before six in
                    the evening, the Resolution opened a close harbour <pb n="228"/> or bay, that
                    trended to the eastward, round a bluff point of high land, and was soon followed
                    by the Discovery. Here both ships cast anchor close under the lee of the land,
                    which we had scarce accomplished, before the boats were ordered out, and some,
                    eager to haul the seine, and others to go a shooting, were impatient to begin,
                    when unexpectedly they were alarmed by four canoes, in which were between 20
                    and 30 Indians not more than two miles distant, and rowing with all their might
                    towards the boats, who not being prepared for such an attack, made the best of
                    their way back to the ships. As the Indians neared the boats, they began their
                    war-song, as their custom is, and brandishing their arms, denounced defiance;
                    but by this time other boats armed from the ships, had joined the sportsmen, who
                    were now so near the ships as to be out of danger. The Indians had then time to
                    cool; they retreated to the opposite side of the harbour, and in a very little
                    time returned, with a white cloak displayed as a signal of peace, which was
                    answered by a white flag; and then they came on board without the least
                    ceremony. Their features, size and colour differed little from those we had
                    just left in George's Sound; but they had a slit between their lower lip and
                    chin, through which they could put their tongue, that gave them the appearance
                    of having a double mouth. Add to this, the ornaments they wore in their noses
                    and ears, of tin and copper, and no figures upon earth could be more grotesque.
                    However, they behaved civilly, and it being near night they took their leave,
                    promising to visit us again in the morning; which they accordingly did,
                    bringing with them the very same forts of skins which we had purchased of the
                    Indians at our former harbour, and which they readily <pb n="229"/> parted
                    with for any thing made of iron, though they were rather choice. These were
                    clothed with the skins of birds neatly sewed together, and they had besides a
                    covering madelike parchment, which in rainy or snowy weather was water proof, so
                    that no wet could affect them. Their ordinary canoes too had coverings of the
                    same kind.</p>
                <p>They had some instruments for fishing, which we did not observe among the more
                    southerly Indians; such as harpoons, and gigs, all of which they were very ready
                    to part with, as well as their clothing, of which, though valuable to us, they
                    made but little account. These were chiefly purchased by the sailors for glass
                    beads, who found them warmer, and better adapted to the climate than any of
                    their other clothing. They had spears also, and lances headed with iron, very
                    neatly manufactured, and knives, which they kept as bright as silver; but these
                    they refused to exchange for any thing we offered.</p>
                <p>In the morning of the 13th, we weighed, and pursued our course to the northward
                    up the strait all day, with the pleasing hope of having found the passage of
                    which we were in search. In our way we passed several very fine rivers that
                    emptied their waters into that which we were now exploring. About four in the
                    afternoon, we came to an anchor in 18 fathom water, and were surrounded with
                    Indians who came to plunder; but finding us on our guard, they sneaked off
                    without their booty. Here, being safely moored just opposite to a small rivulet
                    of excellent water, the boats were ordered out to fill the empty casks, and the
                    carpenters from both ships were set to work to find out the leak in the
                    Resolution; and after a most painful search, a hole was discovered in the ship's
                    side, eaten quite through by the rats; which, by <pb n="230"/> the working of
                    the ship in the storm, had providentially filled with rubbish, and thereby
                    prevented her foundering. So said our Journalist, but Capt. Cook observes, that
                    the seams were open, both in and under the wale; and in several places not a
                    bit of oakum in them.</p>
                <p>On the 14th, while we were employed on this necessary service, we were visited by
                    crowds of Indians, persuading us to proceed; but our pinnace being ordered out,
                    with boats to attend her, in order to examine the strait, it was found to be
                    only an inlet, through which there was no passage for ships or other vessels to
                    any considerable distance. Lat. 60.53.</p>
                <p>To our great disappointment, therefore, after continuing here eight days, during
                    which time every part of the sound had been examined, and the country for
                    several miles round reconnoitred, we took leave of this sound (to which Capt.
                    Cook gave the name of Prince William's Sound) to the great joy of the ships
                    companies, who with working the ships up one day and down another, as wind and
                    tide served, were almost worn down with hard labour, though none were sick; nor
                    did any accident happen to any, except to William Austin, who unfortunately had
                    his leg broke by lifting an anchor out of the boat to launch it overboard, and
                    being entangled in the buoy-rope, went down with it in 22 fathom water, but came
                    up again without any hurt, and was afterwards, by the care of the Surgeon,
                    perfectly cured.</p>
                <p>On the 16th, when the weather, which had been foggy, cleared up, we found
                    ourselves surrounded by land on every side, and sheltered in a nook, called
                    Snug Corner Bay, and a snug corner it certainly was.</p>
                <p>On the 17th, Mr. Gore, from the Resolution, was sent to examine the northern arm
                    of the inlet, Page [unnumbered] [illustration] [depiction of the people of
                    Prince William's Sound] A Man and Woman of Prince William's Sound. p. 230. <pb
                        n="231"/> and Mr. Bligh, the master, to take an easterly direction; this
                    last found the arm, he went to examine, to terminate in a group of islands; Mr.
                    Gore reported that his arm was open, and probably a passage might be found; but
                    Mr. Roberts, who accompanied him, was of opinion, that he saw the end of the
                    inlet; this to Capt. Cook rendered the passage very doubtful; and being willing
                    to pursue his voyage to the North while the season was yet favourable, he
                    resolved to waste no more time in a fruitless search.</p>
                <p>On the 20th, having the weather fine and the wind fair, we returned to sea, not
                    by the same channel, but by one more to the westward than that by which we
                    entered. It was separated from the other by an island, extending 18 leagues, in
                    the direction of North-east and South-west, to which the Commodore gave the name
                    of Montague Island; and the intermediate islands, because of their verdures, he
                    called Green Islands.</p>
                <p>Early on the 21st a storm came on, which obliged us to lay to with the ship's
                    head to the eastward; but in the afternoon it abated, and about five we came up
                    with the southernmost promontory [Cape Elizabeth] which we had seen the day
                    before, and opened on a fine bay, which trended full to the westward, with very
                    high land on both sides.</p>
                <p>In the morning of the 22d we tacked, and stood to the westward, and still saw the
                    land trend very much to the southward. Lat. 59.7. long. 208.26.</p>
                <p>On the 23d, the weather being clear and pleasant, and there being little or no
                    wind, the boats were ordered out, and all hands were employed in fishing, except
                    the Gentlemen, who preferred the diversion of shooting.</p>
                <pb n="232"/>
                <p>On the 24th a stiff breeze sprung up, attended with very heavy squalls, with snow
                    and rain, in which we carried away our main top-gallant-mast in the slings, and
                    received other damage in our sails and rigging. This day we passed a deal of
                    land to the westward, which appeared to us like islands, (among which was that
                    called Cape Hermogenes,) mostly very high; we continued steering as the land
                    trended, and examining every bay and inlet as we passed along. Lat. 58.26.</p>
                <p>On the 25th we altered our course, to N. by W. the land trending away to N. E.
                    high and mountainous. At noon we passed some large islands, bearing from W. S.
                    W. to N. W. and which obtained the name of Barren Isles, and soon after came in
                    sight of a lofty promontory, whose elevated summit, forming two exceedingly
                    high mountains, was seen above the clouds. To this promontory Capt. Cook gave
                    the name of Cape Douglas, in honour of his good friend Dr. Douglas, Canon of
                    Windsor.</p>
                <p>On the 26th, at 3 A. M. we perceived one continued chain of mountains, to the
                    highest of which was given the name of Mount St. Augustine; and saw two very
                    high burning mountains at a considerable distance. We kept steering to the
                    northward, as we saw no land a-head, by reason of a great fog; but as soon as
                    the fog cleared up, we found ourselves in the entrance of a vast river, supposed
                    to be about four miles over, with a strong current setting to the southward,
                    lat. 59.8.</p>
                <p>On the 27th we found the river to widen as we advanced, and the land to flatten.
                    We continued under an easy sail all day and the following night, sounding as we
                    advanced from 30 to 40 fathom, shelly bottom and white sand. We were once more
                    flattered with having found the passage, 〈◊〉 <pb n="233"/> which we were in
                    pursuit, being now in the latitude of 60 degrees north.</p>
                <p>On the 28th, in the morning, we sounded at 24 fathom, the tide still setting
                    strong to the southward at the rate of five and six knots an hour; but the wind
                    dying away, the signal was made for casting anchor, when both ships came to in
                    26 fathom water; but the Resolution expecting to come to with her small stream
                    anchor, let the whole run out, and lost both anchor and hauser, besides the
                    ship's grapnel in looking for it. About 8 at night, the signal was made to weigh
                    and sail; but at ten the current ran so strong, that both ships were again
                    obliged to cast anchor in 24 fathom, bottom same as before. It was now light all
                    night, and we could perceive the river to make N. N. W. very rapid. lat.
                    60.5.</p>
                <p>On the 29th we made sail with a fresh wind, and advanced apace, but on trying the
                    water we found a great alteration from salt to fresh. This day we were visited
                    by several Indians, who brought skins of wolves, foxes, squirrels, deer, and
                    some few beaver, which they exchanged for trifles. In the night we observed
                    they made large fires; but the flames from the two burning mountains seemed to
                    darken their light. We were now close under them, and the roaring they made was
                    infinitely more terrifying than the most tremendous thunder. They are of an
                    immense height, and rise in the form of sugar-loaves, and bore N. and S. of each
                    other, and are called by the natives, Ea-neb-kay. We found regular soundings all
                    this day, till opening into a large wide extended bay, the water shallowed, and
                    we cast anchor in nine fathom water, brown sand and shells as before.</p>
                <pb n="234"/>
                <p>On the 30th, the boats were ordered out, and after a fruitless search to find a
                    passage, sounding from two to four fathom, with the water brackish, they
                    returned in the morning, and were taken on board. In the evening, they renewed
                    their labour, sounding to the north eastward, as the day before they had sounded
                    in the opposite direction.</p>
                <p>On the 31st, the Resolution plyed higher up, and came to an anchor in 16 fathom
                    water, and found the ebb already begun. It ran only three knots an hour, and
                    fell upon a perpendicular 22 feet. Here they saw an opening between the
                    mountains, and were in doubt whether the opening did not take an easterly
                    direction through the above opening; or whether that opening was only a branch
                    of it, and that the main channel continued its northern direction. Next day Mr.
                    Bligh, the master, reported, that he had found the inlet contracted to the
                    breadth of one league by low land, through which it continued its northerly
                    direction; that he proceeded three leagues through this narrow part, which he
                    found navigable for the largest ships; but the water, as it ran down, fresh. He
                    landed on an island, that, it should seem, divided this main channel, and a
                    branch that had an easterly course, upon which he found current bushes, with the
                    fruit already (June) set; and some other fruit-trees unknown to him. About three
                    leagues beyond this, he observed another separation in the eastern chain of
                    mountains, but still thought the main channel preserved its northern direction.
                    To get a nearer view of the eastern branch, the Resolution weighed, and plyed
                    up before high water; but the wind being contrary, he was obliged to cast
                    anchor, and having dispatched two boats to make observations, and examine the
                    tides, they found <pb n="235"/> that the flood set strong into the eastern
                    branch, which Capt. Cook distinguished by the name of River Turnagain; and that
                    the ebb came out with still greater force. Being now convinced, that no passage
                    was to be expected by this river, any more than by the main branch, Capt. Cook
                    gave orders to Mr. King to land on the northern point of the low land, there to
                    display the flag, and take possession of the country and river, and to bury in
                    the ground a bottle, containing some pieces of English coin, of the year 1772,
                    and a paper, on which was inscribed the names of the ships, and the date of the
                    discovery. In the mean time, a party of us, with officers, attended by a
                    serjeant's guard of marines, landed on the easternmost shore, in order to
                    reconnoitre the country. We had proceeded more than four miles without seeing
                    one inhabitant, and were going to scour the woods for game, when a body of
                    Indians, to the number of forty or fifty, rushed out of an adjoining thicket,
                    all armed after their manner with bows and spears; a few of our marines
                    discharged their pieces over their heads, which instantly stopt their career;
                    and they were retreating as rapidly as they came on, when the officer, who had
                    the command, advancing singly grounded his piece, and made signs for them to
                    halt. One who seemed to have the command of the rest, turning suddenly about,
                    observed his motions, and understood them; and calling to the rest, they all
                    stopt, and, after a short consultation, laid down their arms, and stripping
                    themselves quite naked, laid their clothes down by them. This we understood
                    they did, to show that they had no arms concealed. We then advanced, and entered
                    into a kind of dumb discourse, of which we could understand enough to know that
                    they wanted us to accompany them to their town, which we very <pb n="236"/>
                    readily did; they very deliberately put on their clothes, and then shewed us the
                    way.</p>
                <p>When we arrived, we found a number of wretched huts, with women and children, old
                    men and dogs, who at first sight of us, were more frightened than their masters,
                    hanging their tails, and sneaking away. One of these Mr. Law, our Surgeon,
                    purchased. These huts consisted of nothing but long poles, rudely constructed
                    into the form of a hovel, and covered over with heathy earth. For a door, they
                    had a hole just large enough to creep in at, which, in cold weather, they close
                    with a kind of faggot. Their inner apartments were holes or pits dug in the
                    earth, and divided like stalls in a stable. Their furniture we did not take the
                    pains to survey. We saw some bladders full of blubber or fat, hanging about, and
                    some skins of beasts; also, dried fish in plenty. We likewise saw several wooden
                    utensils, besides their arms; and we saw quantities of salt in wooden troughs.
                    They had dried flesh, too, probably the remains of their winter provisions,
                    which we understood they eat raw, and some of which they offered us for dinner.
                    In these huts, or holes, they burn no fire; but in the winter they shut
                    themselves up close, and have lamps, which they continually keep burning: for
                    here, during the winter months, they scarce ever see the sun. We were not a
                    little surprised at the sight of some of their children, who were as fair, and
                    their skins as white, as those of many children in England; their dark coppery
                    complexion is therefore owing to their anointing and greasing their children
                    when they are young, and exposing them to all weathers while they have light,
                    and shutting them in their smoaky caverns when it is dark. We found little or no
                    difference between <pb n="237"/> the people in this sound and those we have
                    described in the other, except having large drops or ornaments at their ears
                    and noses, of beads of their own making. These they would not part with. They
                    had gloves and boots likewise of their own manufacturing, and cloaks very
                    curiously wrought. Their hair in general was long and black, which they dress
                    and decorate with feathers and down. The women wear ornaments of ivory, beads,
                    or transparent stones, which they hang to their ears, or run across their
                    nostrils with a needle of bone about an inch and a half long, having another of
                    equal length, which they pass cross a false mouth just above the chin. To these
                    they string their ornaments, as in the figure annexed: and in this consists
                    their pride. Having gratified our curiosity, we returned to our ships; and
                    having nothing farther to detain us, On the 2d of June, in the afternoon, we
                    set sail. The same afternoon, the Resolution struck, and stuck fast on a bank in
                    the middle of the river; but on the return of the tide, floated off without any
                    damage. We were now in lat. 61.15. N. and in long. 209.55. E. many leagues
                    within land, and it was not till the 6th that we cleared the channel.</p>
                <p>The 4th, being his Majesty's birth-day we kept as a day of rejoicing.</p>
                <p>On the 5th, we passed the burning mountains, and the wind dying away, we cast
                    anchor, and shooting and fishing now took place of watching and hard labour.
                    While the crews were pursuing their sport, two canoes approached the ships, with
                    more than forty strangers, who were differently clothed from those Indians we
                    had hitherto seen in this latitude. They brought with them curiosities of
                    various kinds and shapes; also great quantities of skins of seals, wolves, deer,
                    black <pb n="238"/> and white foxes, racoons, martins, sables, and some few
                    beavers, which they themselves had compleatly manufactured, and were soon
                    purchased by those on board. The dress of these men were skins of birds, with
                    the feathers outwards, very neatly sewed, and reaching from the neck to the
                    mid-leg. Under these they had a kind of trowsers, which parted in the middle,
                    and surrounded their thighs. Under their feet they had a coarse covering that
                    served for shoes. All these, though the weather was cold, they parted with, and
                    most of them went naked from the ships, making signs for us to follow them,
                    though it was not easy to discover from whence they came, nor where they were to
                    go.</p>
                <p>The 6th, a breeze sprang up, and we cleared the strait, to the unspeakable joy of
                    the sailors, who, during the whole time from our entrance till our return,
                    worked with incredible labour, anchoring and weighing as in the former sound,
                    just as the winds and the tide afforded opportunity. During our passage, we had
                    frequent interviews with the natives, who, the nearer we approached the shore,
                    were, as we have observed, better clothed, and shewed some manufactures of their
                    own, and of other nations; and were in possession of a greater variety of skins
                    than those within land, which were strong indications of a foreign trade; but by
                    what conveyance carried on, all our endeavours at this time could not discover.
                    This day we passed the barren isles.</p>
                <p> On the 7th, at noon, St. Hermogenes bore N. four leagues distant. It appeared
                    green and fertile.</p>
                <p>On the 8th, we continued this course with very little variation, till night, when
                    a thick fog came <pb n="239"/> on, and we lost sight of the Resolution. This
                    weather continued till The 10th, when the Resolution, in coasting along the
                    main, ran foul of a dangerous reef, that appeared just above water, close under
                    her leebow. Her good fortune still accompanied her, for she slid off without
                    damage. Lat. 56.44. long. 207.53.</p>
                <p>On the 11th, we were alarmed by the clashing of the waves, as if some great
                    building was tumbling in, and looking round the ship, we saw ourselves involved
                    among shoals of seals and sea-lions, who presently set up the most frightful
                    howlings; at the same time, we observed a large whale to pass along, at which we
                    fired a swivel, but without effect. We this day stood to the North-East as the
                    land trended.</p>
                <p>On the 12th, Cape St. Barnabas bore N. 52. E. At eight o'clock, we opened upon
                    some new land, the extreme Eastward point of which bore E. S. E. In the evening
                    we stood S.</p>
                <p>On the 14th, in the morning, we saw Trinity Island, distant 7 or 8 leagues, lat.
                    56.23. lon. 205.16. We directed our course along shore.</p>
                <p>On the 15th, the weather hazy, we lost sight of land, sounded, and found no
                    ground at 100 fathom. A storm came on, and both ships stood to sea.</p>
                <p>On the 16th, it abated, the weather clear, [came in sight of Foggy Island, so
                    called by Beering] stood W. N. W. with a stiff breeze; lat. at noon by
                    observation, 56.24. long. 202.17.</p>
                <p>On the 17th, stood in, and saw land trend S. ½ E. as far as the eye could carry.
                    At nine in the morning we opened a large bay, the entrance of which from S. W.
                    to N. W. about three miles over; but having a fine breeze in our favour, we <pb
                        n="240"/> continued along shore. We were now about two leagues distant from
                    the shore, which was covered with geese, ducks, shags, and sea-fowls,
                    innumerable.</p>
                <p>On the 19th, we coasted along shore, and passed many dangerous rocks and shoals,
                    which we saw project from the main into the sea to a great distance. We were now
                    in lat. 55.26. long. 200.48. E. At two in the afternoon, we passed two large
                    islands to the Southward of us, and about three had passed all the land to the
                    Southward, when, being within half a mile of the main, we observed three canoes
                    making towards us, in which were six Indians. When they came along side, they
                    made signs for us to drop our anchors, intimating that the people on shore
                    would be glad to see us; at the same time, we thought we heard the report of a
                    gun. Little notice, however, was taken of what passed. The people from the
                    gang-way talked with the men, one of whom made signs for letting down a rope, to
                    which he tied a neat box, curiously made up with small twine, for which he would
                    take nothing in return. The man who took it, looked upon it as a great
                    curiosity; and, after the Indians were gone, began to examine the contents,
                    when a note was found in the inside, which was immediately carried to the
                    Captain, and a consultation was held on the quarter-deck to endeavour to
                    decypher the contents; but none on board the Discovery could make out a letter.
                    The ship was then hove-to, three guns fired, and a jack hoisted to the mast-head
                    for stopping the Resolution. This being observed, all on board were struck with
                    fear for the safety of the Discovery, thinking that some fatal disaster had
                    happened, and that she was going to the bottom. Their boat was instantly hoisted
                    out, <pb n="241"/> and Mr. Williamson, third Lieutenant, came in all haste to
                    learn the cause. With him our Captain returned, and related what had happened,
                    and shewed Captain Cook the note, who likewise held a consultation upon it, and
                    it was handed from the quarter-deck to the gang-way, where every man in the ship
                    might see it; but not a man could make out more than something like the date
                    1778, of which they were not clear. We therefore continued our course along the
                    coast as the land trended, but saw no opening, nor any inhabitants. About
                    midnight, we saw a vast flame ascend from a burning mountain, and observed
                    several fires within land. Latitude by observation 54.47. N. long. 197.52.
                    E.</p>
                <p>On the 20th, early in the morning, looking out a-head, we saw something like a
                    reef before us, and fired a gun for the Resolution to tack; happy that day-light
                    had enabled us to escape the danger.</p>
                <p>On the 21st, we steered S. W. but at eight A. M. finding the land to trend more
                    to the Southward, we altered our course to S. S. W. the extreme of the land in
                    sight bearing W. by S. seven or eight leagues, very high land, and much snow.
                    About two in the afternoon, we came again in sight of the two burning mountains,
                    which we had before seen, but at a great distance, bearing N. W. by N. Our
                    course during the night was S. S. W. During the course of this day, the weather
                    being fair, and but little wind, the men were employed in fishing; and in less
                    than four hours caught more than three ton weight of cod and holybut, some of
                    the latter more than a hundred pounds weight. Here a man in a small canoe came
                    on board the Resolution. He bowed and pulled off his cap, and shewed evident
                    signs of <pb n="242"/> having had commercial dealings with the Russians. He wore
                    a pair of green cloth breeches, and a jacket of black cloth. He had nothing to
                    barter, except a grey fox skin.</p>
                <p>On the 22d, our men were employed in salting and barreling up, for future use,
                    what the ship's company could not consume while fresh, which proved a most
                    acceptable supply. All this day we kept our course S. W. by S.</p>
                <p>On the 23d, in the evening, we shaped our course more to the Westward, the
                    weather thick and hazy.</p>
                <p>On the 24th, little wind and hazy. Saw no land; but looking over the ship's side,
                    observed the water to change to a milky white. Sounded, and found ground at 47
                    fathom. About four P. M. we saw two very high islands bearing N. W. distance
                    about five leagues, and could discern the main land contiguous. We bore away
                    under the lee of the Westernmost, and continued steering all night S. by W.</p>
                <p>On the 25th, in the morning, we changed our course, steering S. W. as the land
                    trended. At ten the same morning, we had a full view of the land for many miles,
                    but saw no signs of houses or inhabitants; but doubtless, though the country
                    appeared rugged and barren, and in many places white with snow, there were many
                    people in the inland parts. About seven in the evening we could see land at a
                    great distance, bearing due South, which had the appearance of a large island.
                    Hitherto we had been exploring the coasts of an unknown continent; unknown, at
                    least, to our European geographers: though we shall see by the sequel, that it
                    was not wholly unexplored by the Asiatic Russians. Towards night, though it had
                    been perfectly clear all day, the air began to <pb n="243"/> thicken, and by ten
                    at night the fog was so thick that we could not see the ship's length. We kept
                    firing guns, burning false fires, and standing off land all night, as did the
                    Resolution; and in the morning of the 26th, when the fog dispersed, we found
                    ourselves in a deep bay, surrounded by high lands, and almost ashore under a
                    high mountain, which we had not before discerned. Both ships instantly dropt
                    anchor in 24 fathom water, blue muddy bottom, within two cables length of the
                    shore, and among shoals and breakers, from which we most miraculously escaped.
                    For some time we stood in amazement how we could possibly get into such a
                    frightful situation. But being in it, for our own safety we moored both ships;
                    and happy it was we used that precaution; for a gale came on, when our whole
                    existence depended upon the goodness of our cables. In the evening, the boats
                    were got out, and the Captain, with several other gentlemen, went on shore; but
                    with great danger were landed, as were likewise some boats from both ships, to
                    cut grass for the live stock that yet remained. They afterwards found that this
                    was an island, called by the Russians, Vonulashka Island; but saw no
                    inhabitants. In their excursion the gentlemen shot two eagles and several other
                    birds of various sorts, and soon returned on board the ships. Lat. obs. 53.39.
                    Long. 193.16. E.</p>
                <p>On the 27th, at three A. M. it ceased blowing, and the weather began to clear. At
                    six we unmoored, and sailed under close reefed top-sails, directing our course
                    N. W. for an opening we saw at about a league distance; but at nine the wind
                    dying away, we anchored again in 25 fathom water, loamy sand. It being a dead
                    calm, our <pb n="244"/> boats were ordered out, and some gentlemen went again on
                    shore, to examine the island more closely. In their search they found something
                    like an Indian mansion, being a deep pit sunk in the earth, with some poles
                    placed across it after their manner, and covered with sods, and a hole to creep
                    into it about two feet square. In it they found the bones of dried fish, and of
                    birds, and near it a place where there had been a fire, but all had the
                    appearance of being long deserted. They also found the rib of a whale, about
                    eight feet long, which it was not easy to account how it could come there. About
                    noon the gentlemen returned on board, and a breeze springing up from the
                    Eastward, we weighed, and took leave of this dangerous bay, to which Capt. Cook
                    gave the name of Providence Bay, as it was owing to Providence that we were
                    here miraculously preserved from perishing. We had pleasant weather all day, and
                    the land high all round us. We sounded all the afternoon from 18 to 36 fathom,
                    mostly sandy bottom. In the evening we saw a large body of Indians towing a
                    whale which they had struck, who were too busy to mind us till late, when two
                    canoes came along-side and traded. We were surprised when they asked us for
                    tobacco, and more so when they shewed us some, together with snuff in their
                    boxes. As tobacco was a precious commodity on board, we could spare them little,
                    but for that little they were thankful, and departed. We passed several islands
                    to the Eastward, very high and mountainous.</p>
                <p>On the 28th, in the morning, Mr. Nelson, accompanied by several other gentlemen,
                    went on shore botanizing; they found great variety of plants and flowers
                    peculiar to the country, besides others, with which we were all well acquainted;
                        <pb n="245"/> such as primroses, violets, currants, rasberries, juniper, and
                    many other Northern fruits, which were now all in blossom. They found also a
                    bird's nest, with five small eggs, not unlike a sparrow's. After some stay they
                    came again on board, and the wind dying away, and the Resolution having got far
                    a-head, our boats were employed in towing us, when a strong current meeting us
                    right a-head, baffled their endeavours. This current ran with such force, that
                    the Resolution, unable to stem it, cast anchor, and soon after was joined by
                    the Discovery. Here several canoes came from the land to trade, and made signs
                    for more tobacco, of which our own men were in great want. About noon we opened
                    on a fine harbour to the Westward of us; but we were the whole afternoon in
                    working up the Race, as it was called, from the rapidity of its motion, and the
                    strength with which it set against us. Our first attempt to stem it proved
                    fruitless. We were driven as far back as the place from whence we set out. On
                    the tide's turning in our favour, we made a second attempt, and succeeded. About
                    six in the evening, we cast anchor 12 fathom water, and soon after came to
                    moorings. We were, in less than an hour, surrounded with more than thirty
                    canoes, with rock fish and dried salmon, which they exchanged for beads, small
                    nails, or any thing we offered them. They had likewise some very pretty baskets
                    of their own making, with other utensils, which plainly indicated a
                    communication with foreign traders.</p>
                <p>On the 29th, the boats were employed in watering the ships, and the sail-makers,
                    &amp;c. began to overhaul the rigging, and all hands were employed in different
                    repairs. In the mean time several Indians hovered round the ships with fish <pb
                        n="246"/> ready dressed, which they presented to any indiscriminately who
                    would accept them; but would take nothing in return, except tobacco or snuff
                    were offered them; neither did they offer to steal or take any the most trifling
                    thing away: and what was remarkable, not a woman was to be seen, nor did any
                    come near the ship during our stay. Our Captain took notice of two that seemed
                    superior to the rest, he invited them on board, and with much entreaty
                    prevailed on them to enter. He made them presents of a few beads, and two or
                    three hands of tobacco each, for which they in the most submissive manner
                    expressed their gratitude. All this while our botanist and his attendants were
                    busily employed, and sent plenty of celery and other wholesome herbs on board,
                    as well for the use of the great cabin as for those of the subordinate tables,
                    down even to the lowest of the ship's company.</p>
                <p>On the 30th both Captains landed, in order to survey the island, and take a more
                    accurate view of the harbour, Captain Cook intending to make this the place of
                    rendezvous on his return: they met with several friendly Indians in their way,
                    to whom they made presents.</p>
                <p>On the 1st of July the signal was given to unmoor; but, the wind shifting to N.
                    N. E. Mr. Edgar, master of the Discovery, accompanied by several other
                    gentlemen, made a visit to an Indian town, which they saw at the distance of
                    five or six miles, situated on the side of a pleasant little hill, that seemed
                    to command a view of the bay, and of a great extent of country around. At this
                    town they arrived about ten in the morning, when a well-looking old man made
                    them understand he was chief of the place. To him therefore they made their
                    addresses, by presenting him with some Page [unnumbered] [illustration]
                    [depiction of the people of Onalashka] A Man and Woman of Onalashka. p. 246. <pb
                        n="247"/> trifles, and a small hand of tobacco. By way of return, he made
                    signs for the strangers to sit down; and when they were seated, he brought them
                    fish of various sorts, dried and fresh, and some dried venison, which, however,
                    they declined to taste: observing, therefore, that the strangers wanted only to
                    satisfy their curiosity, he made signs for them to follow him; leading them to
                    every house, and, last of all, to his own. These houses were no other than
                    square caverns dug in the ground, and latticed with rough poles, over which were
                    laid sods of earth, leaving a square hole in the middle like a hatch-way,
                    through which to enter. They descended by means of a ladder, made by cutting
                    notches in a beam, deep enough to receive the toes and the ball of the foot;
                    and by that ladder women and children, as well as men, run up and down like so
                    many rats, without fear of falling. The old Indian did not seem willing to shew
                    the gentlemen the inside of the houses, nor were they over-solicitous to examine
                    them. The smell, when they looked down, was enough to satisfy them. These holes
                    or houses, if they may be so called, were some of them forty feet long, thirty
                    broad, and about twelve feet deep. In these they never burn fire, but kindle
                    their fires at some distance, chiefly in the night, but for what reason we could
                    never learn. Hence it is, that sailors are enabled to judge of the populousness
                    of a country by the number of these fires that are seen from the shore. From the
                    houses the old Indian led them to the sheds where they manufactured their
                    skins; shewed their manner of dressing them, their store-houses, and in short,
                    all their arts and artificers, their women only excepted, of whom one only made
                    her appearance, and she was old, and far from being inviting. About <pb n="248"
                    /> eight in the afternoon the gentlemen returned; and however they might be
                    surfeited with what they had seen, they shewed by the dinner they made that they
                    had not lost their appetite.</p>
                <p>While Mr. Edgar, &amp;c. were thus pleasing themselves with one kind of
                    amusement, Mr. Law, Surgeon, was diverting himself with another. He went a
                    hunting, and traced an old fox to her cover, where, after digging a considerable
                    way, he found seven young ones; two of which he brought on board, and one of
                    them lived a long time after.</p>
                <p>On the 2d of July we cleared the harbour, called by the inhabitants Samganooda,
                    situated on the North-side of Oonalashka, in lat. 53.35. long. 193.30. About
                    noon we saw the land trend to S. S. E. hauled up to E. N. E. and continued all
                    night in that course.</p>
                <p>On the 3d, at two A. M. she wore ship, and stood to the Southward till day-light,
                    and then tacked, and steered E. N. E. At noon we saw the extreme of the land,
                    bearing E. ½ S.</p>
                <p>On the 4th, at two A. M. we steered N. N. E. At ten sounded at seventy fathom,
                    blue mud, shelly bottom, and making very little way, our men were employed in
                    fishing, and in less than four hours catched upwards of 800 weight of cod. At
                    noon we had an observation, lat. 55.49. N. long. 195.34. Course all night N.
                    E.</p>
                <p>On the 5th, we saw the land very low and even, trending away to the Southward of
                    the East. We were distant from the Northernmost shore three or four leagues, and
                    from this day we began sounding till our arrival in watering harbour. This day
                    all hands employed in fishing; and as our people were now put on two-thirds
                    allowance, what each caught he might eat or sell. Fortunate for them, they
                    caught some tons of fine <pb n="249"/> fish, which proved a most seasonable
                    supply; for the ship provisions, what with salt and maggots eating into the
                    beef and pork, and the rats and weavils devouring the heart of the bread, the
                    one was little better than putrid flesh, and the other, upon breaking, would
                    crumble into dust. At noon, this day, we directed our course N. N. E. being now
                    in lat. 56.36. long. 196.19. per watch.</p>
                <p>On the 6th we continued the same course, and, sounding, found ground at twelve
                    fathom. We tacked, and stood to the S. E. and, sounding again, found ground at
                    three fathoms and a half. We were now in Beering's Straits. We tacked instantly,
                    and stood to the North, having had another providential escape from running
                    upon the rocks. We got out our boats, and sounded from 7 to 5½ fathom, rocky
                    bottom for eight or nine leagues to the Northward. Lat. 57.4. long. 199.40. We
                    were now in a most perilous and laborious navigation; sounding every day, and
                    every day in danger of perishing on the rocks.</p>
                <p>On the 7th sounded from twelve to four fathom, hard bottom, with shells. Lat.
                    57.17. long. 200.6.</p>
                <p>On the 8th sounded from seven to twenty fathom; small shells, with sand. Lat.
                    57.46. long. 201.40. per watch.</p>
                <p>On the 9th a great fog; lay by most part of the day; sounded from six to ten
                    fathoms and a half; lat. by observation 58.15. long. 201.11.</p>
                <p>On the 10th we had thunder, hail, and rain. The men almost exhausted with
                    fatigue; sounded from twelve to nine fathoms and a half. Lat. 57.58. long.
                    221.19.</p>
                <p>The 11th we came in sight of land. The air clear and pleasant; we steered N. W.
                    by W. the <pb n="250"/> Westward point of land in sight, bearing W. ½ N. This
                    day the gentlemen from both ships diverted themselves in shooting. At noon our
                    Captain returned on board with three sea-parrots, four pigeons, several gulls,
                    teals, and shags. These parrots are in size and shape not unlike those on land,
                    but web-footed, and their plumage different. Numbers of them were shot, and
                    brought to England as curiosities. The pigeons too are much like those on land,
                    but web-footed, and make a most disagreeable cooing, much like the croaking of
                    the sea-lion; sounded from twelve to six fathoms. Lat. 58.11. long. 199.50.</p>
                <p>On the 12th nothing material; the day was pleasant, and he had a full view of the
                    land, but saw neither tree nor bush; sounded from eight to sixteen fathom.
                    Latitude by observation 58.20.</p>
                <p>The 13th, sounded from eight to thirteen fathom. Lat. 58.13. long. 198.8.</p>
                <p>The 14th we coasted along shore, N. N. W. and at three in the afternoon found
                    ourselves to the windward of the Southward point, with a strong tide setting to
                    the S. E. About four a thick fog arose, and being within two miles of the shore,
                    came to an anchor in ten fathom water, the extreme point of land to the
                    Westward, bearing N. N. W. very high; distant between six and seven leagues.
                    Sounded all day from ten to twelve fathom. Latitude by observation 58.20. long.
                    197.51.</p>
                <p>The 15th, about ten in the morning, the weather clear and fine, we came to an
                    anchor in seventeen fathom water, lat. 58.24. long. 197.4. Here the cutters from
                    both ships were manned, and all the gentlemen went on shore. We saw no other
                    inhabitants but bears and foxes, and some wild deer; we heard in the adjoining
                    woods <pb n="251"/> the howlings and yellings of wolves and other wild beasts;
                    but thought it neither safe nor seasonable to pursue them. After spending the
                    greatest part of the day in botanizing with Mr. Nelson, we returned on board,
                    leaving on the bluff part of a rock a bottle behind us, in which were enclosed
                    some blue and white beads, with a note of the ships names, the date when left,
                    by whom, and on what expedition. We found near the shore the horns of some
                    sea-monsters, from twenty to twenty-four inches long, nearly as thick as a man's
                    leg at the root, and tapering to a point, with a gradual sweep. Lat. 58.24.
                    long. 197.4. We were no sooner returned than a breeze sprang up, when we
                    weighed, and again made sail, with the ships heads W. N. W.</p>
                <p>The 16th, the water shallowed so fast, that it was thought prudent to drop
                    anchors again, and to send the boats out with a compass to examine the strait to
                    a considerable distance a-head. In half an hour a gun was fired from the boats,
                    as a signal not to proceed, and the man at the mast-head saw land appear just
                    above water. This proved a barren spot, not above an acre wide, with nothing but
                    shells and the bones of fishes on it. The boats having sounded from W. to N. W.
                    by N. from two to one fathom and a half, returned with their report, that no
                    passage could be found in that direction. From this day to the 20th, the boats
                    were continually sounding in all directions amidst the most dreadful tempest of
                    thunder, lightning, and hail, that ever blew; but such was our danger, that
                    Capt. Cook himself shared in all the labour: and what added to our misfortune,
                    the Resolution parted her best bower within ten fathoms of the anchor, and it
                    was wonderful that she was not wrecked. Lat. 58.40. long. 196.40.</p>
                <pb n="252"/>
                <p>On the 17th all hands that could be spared were employed in sweeping for the
                    anchor, but in vain; being quite worn down with fatigue, they were forced to
                    give over, and men from the Discovery were ordered to supply their places.
                    Latitude by observation 58.53. long. 197.4.</p>
                <p>On the 18th the anchor was recovered, when every officer on board both ships was
                    obliged to do the duty of common men. No pen can describe our danger from the
                    horrible situation we were in.</p>
                <p>The 19th was wholly employed in sounding from eight to two fathom. Lat. 59.37.
                    long. 197.17.</p>
                <p>On the 20th Captain Cook himself, in sounding to the S. E. found a narrow
                    channel, regular soundings, from eight to ten fathom. Hope took place of
                    despair, and all hands returned to their labour with fresh spirits. We presently
                    weighed, and pursued our course with a fine breeze. The day continuing clear, at
                    noon we had an observation in lat. 59.37. long. 197. E. This day we were
                    visited by some Indians, who had little to part with, except dried fish, and
                    bows and arrows. The only peculiarity we observed was, that most of them had
                    their heads shaved close. They seemed fondest of Otaheite and other Indian
                    cloth, for which they would part with any thing.</p>
                <p>On the 21st, about noon, both ships brought to, the wind and current both uniting
                    to oppose our progress; founded from twelve to five fathoms and a half. Lat.
                    59.26. long. 197.18.</p>
                <p>On the 22d we were overjoyed, on sounding, to find the sea deepen to forty
                    fathom; but, before night that joy was much damped by a prodigious fall of snow,
                    of which it was with difficulty that the decks could be kept clear, though the
                    water <pb n="253"/> was constantly employed in shovelling it off during the
                    night. Lat. 59.11. long. 197.14. course S. S. W.</p>
                <p>The 23d made sail, and steered W. Lat. 58.26.</p>
                <p>The 24th continued our course W. by S.</p>
                <p>The 25th lay to most of the day, by reason of the fog. Lat. 57.43. long. 193.</p>
                <p>The 26th, when it began to clear up.</p>
                <p>On the 27th we had clear weather, and regular soundings, from twenty-seven to
                    thirty fathom; black sand and small shells.</p>
                <p>On the 28th sounded all day from twenty-eight to thirty-three fathoms; sandy
                    bottom.</p>
                <p>On the 29th the man at the mast-head called out land very high, distance about
                    two leagues right a-head. We tacked, and stood off. Long 189.20. per watch.</p>
                <p>On the 30th we continued along-shore, course N. ½ E. sounding from twenty-five to
                    thirty-five fathom. Lat. 61.14. long. 190.10.</p>
                <p>The 31st we were again alarmed with irregular soundings, from ten to thirty
                    fathom, but were soon relieved, by the water deepening. Lat. 31.20. long.
                    188.11. per watch.</p>
                <p>August the 1st, the sea continued to deepen, but the land trending to the
                    southward, obliged us to change our course. We were now in lat. 60.59. N. long.
                    191.47. E.</p>
                <p>On the 2d we again bore away N. W. all the morning, and at noon tacked to N. E.
                    by N. Lat. 62.13. long. 191.33.</p>
                <p>The 3d, course all day N. N. E. This course we pursued, with a little variation
                    to the eastward, till the evening, when we saw land, bearing S. W. distance
                    seven or eight leagues. Latitude by observation 63.4. long. 192.10. This day,
                    word was brought us from the Resolution of the death <pb n="254"/> of Mr.
                    Anderson, the surgeon. His funeral was performed with the usual sea-ceremonies;
                    and our surgeon, Mr. Law, was appointed in his place; and Mr. Samuel, surgeon's
                    mate of the Resolution, succeeded Mr. Law.</p>
                <p>The 4th at noon, sounding from fifteen toten fathom we came again in sight of
                    land, which bore from us W. to N. ½ E. At noon we sounded, and found only eight
                    fathoms and a half. In the evening we came to an anchor in fifteen fathom. Lat.
                    64.44. long. 192.7.</p>
                <p>On the 5th, we came to in twelve fathom water, under the lee of a small but high
                    island, in lat. 64.41. long. 192.14. to which Captain Cook gave the name of
                    Sledge Island, as a sledge and the remains of a Russian town were found upon it,
                    but no inhabitants. There were likewise found some Russian snow-shoes. Mr.
                    Nelson, and his associates found, on this island, great quantities of wild
                    celery, and a kind of wild vetch or chichling, of which the ship's company made
                    the proper use.</p>
                <p>Early on the 6th we weighed, and stood W. by N. As we coasted along shore,
                    several Indians were seen on the opposite side of the island, who were, to all
                    appearance, preparing to pay us a visit. We hove to; but, after waiting an hour,
                    and none coming, we continued our course. We soon came again into shallow water,
                    and finding the land too near us from the western shore, we altered our course
                    to N. N. W. sounding from four to six fathom water, six leagues from the main
                    land. We were now obliged to come to anchor, as a heavy snow darkened the air,
                    and rendered our proceeding hazardous. Lat. 4.44. long. 192.42.</p>
                <pb n="255"/>
                <p>On the 7th, judging ourselves near the shore, though not in sight, we weighed and
                    tacked; and as the fog dispersed, we saw the land mountainous and rocky, with
                    neither tree nor shrub in sight, but exhibiting the most dreary prospect that
                    the mind of man can conceive. At the same time, an island was seen bearing N.
                    81. W. eight or nine leagues distant, named by us King's Island. It seemed of no
                    great extent. We hastened from this horrid situation, but in the course of the
                    day were under the necessity of coming to an anchor three times; but in
                    launching it the last time, we observed the stock of our best bower to be
                    sprung. Nothing could equal our apprehensions. We immediately made signals, and
                    acquainted our Commodore with our distress. Fortunately, the stock of an
                    unserviceable best-bower hung over our side, which, by the assistance of the
                    carpenters and smiths of the Resolution, added to our own, was in less than
                    twenty-four hours, though under every disadvantage, substituted in the room of
                    the other, and rendered perfectly safe. And happy it was, for On the 8th, we had
                    a violent storm of hail, rain and snow, which continued all the morning; but the
                    wind dying away about noon, and the current setting to the N. E. we were drifted
                    to leeward close in shore, under a very high track of land, and among rocks and
                    breakers. Both ships instantly came to in 9 fathom water, the Resolution with
                    her best-bower, within two miles of the shore, and the Discovery with her
                    coasting anchor. Here we saw high land, extending from N. by W. to N. W. by N.
                    distant about three leagues. Over the western extreme was an elevated peaked
                    hill, situated in lat. 65.36. and in long. 192.18. Under this hill lies some low
                    land, stretching out <pb n="256"/> to the N. W. the extreme point of which bore
                    F. by E. This point of land is the more remarkable, being the western extremity
                    of all America hitherto known, and named by Capt. Cook Cape Prince of Wales.
                    And now a breeze springing up in our favour, we quitted this perilous
                    situation; and seeing the land trend away to the N. W. we directed our course
                    accordingly, till, having doubled the westernmost point, we steered again to the
                    eastward, and continued that course the whole night.</p>
                <p>On the 9th about 2 A. M. we came again to an anchor, a strong current from 5 to 6
                    knots an hour setting against us; but the ships pitching bows under, and the
                    water from the upper deck running, as through a sieve, to the lower deck, in
                    less than half an hour, every thing between decks was afloat, so that the poor
                    men had not a dry rag to put on. This obliged us to weigh as fast as possible;
                    but, in our situation, that was a work of no small labour and difficulty, as at
                    this time many of our hands, through fatigue, and being constantly exposed to
                    the rain and snow, and in a damp ship, were ill of colds, attended with slow
                    fevers, which rendered them incapable of duty. Out of 70 hands, officers
                    included, we could only muster 20 to the capstern. We had with difficulty
                    weighed our small bower, and had made two unsuccessful attempts at the sheet
                    anchor, when the Resolution left us, making all the sail she could carry, to
                    surmount the current. We were now in the utmost distress; but by contriving
                    several additional purchases we at last succeeded, with the misfortune,
                    however, of having two of our ablest hands wounded; and it was next to a miracle
                    that none were killed. The Resolution was now out of sight, but, judging our
                    distress, she lay to amidst <pb n="257"/> a cluster of islands, of which we told
                    no less than seven, very small but very high. As soon as we came in sight, she
                    made sail, and we followed with all the sail we could crowd till about
                    midnight, when we were surprised by a sudden squall, which split our main
                    top-sail, and shivered our jib to ribbons; it was, however, of short
                    continuance. Lat. 65.46. long. 191.45.</p>
                <p>On the 10th, we had fine weather and a calm sea, and were proceeding, at a great
                    rate, our course W. when, unexpectedly we opened into a deep bay, where we saw
                    at the distance of a few leagues, a large Indian town, which our Commodore at
                    first supposed to belong to the island of Alaschka; but from the figure of the
                    coast, the situation of the opposite shore of America, and from the longitude,
                    he found reason to alter his opinion, and to conclude that it was a part of the
                    country of Tschutski, or the eastern extremity of Asia, explored by Beering in
                    1728. Long 189.25. Here we cast anchor in 13 fathom water, and both Captains,
                    attended by a proper guard went on shore. About 30 or 40 men, each armed with a
                    spontoon, a bow and arrows, stood drawn up on a rising ground close by the
                    village. As we drew near, three of them came down towards the shore, and were so
                    polite as to take off their caps, and to make us low bows. We returned the
                    civility, but this did not inspire them with sufficient confidence; for the
                    moment we advanced, they retired. Capt. Cook followed them alone, without any
                    thing in his hand; and by signs, prevailed on them to receive some trifling
                    presents. In return, they gave him two fox skins, and a couple of sea-horse
                    teeth. They seemed very cautious; expressing their desire by signs, that no more
                    of our people might be permitted to come up. On <pb n="258"/> Capt. Cook's
                    laying his hand on the shoulder of one of them, he started back, and in
                    proportion as the Captain advanced, the natives retreated; always in the
                    attitude of being ready to make use of their spears, while those on the rising
                    ground stood ready to support them with their arrows. Insensibly, a few of our
                    people got in among them; but a few beads being distributed to those about them,
                    soon created a confidence, and, by degrees, a sort of traffic commenced. In
                    exchange for knives, beads, tobacco, and other articles, they gave us some of
                    their clothing, and a few arrows; but nothing could induce them to part with a
                    spear, or a bow. These they held in constant readiness, never quitting them,
                    except at one time, when four or five of them laid theirs down, while they gave
                    us a song and a dance. Their arrows were pointed either with bone or stone, but
                    very few of them had barbs, and some were blunted. The use they made of these
                    was, probably, to kill small animals, without damaging their skins. The bows
                    were such as we had seen used by the American Esquimaux. The spears or
                    spontoons were of iron or steel, of European or Asiatic workmanship, curiously
                    ornamented with carvings and inlayings of brass and white metal. Those who stood
                    ready with their bows and arrows, had their spears slung over their right
                    shoulders; a quiver slung over their left with arrows; some of their quivers
                    were extremely beautiful, being made of red leather, on which were very neat
                    embroidery, and other ornaments. Several other things, and in particular their
                    clothing, shewed they were not destitute of ingenuity.</p>
                <p>All the Americans we had seen since our arrival on that coast, were rather low
                    of stature, with round chubby faces, and high cheek bones. <pb n="259"/> The
                    people we now were among, had long visages, and were stout and well-made. In
                    short, they appeared to be a quite different nation. We saw neither women nor
                    children; nor any aged, except one man, who was bald-headed, and carried no
                    arms. The other seemed to be picked men, and rather under than above the middle
                    age. All of them had their ears bored, and some of them had glass beads hanging
                    to them. These were the only fixed ornaments we saw among them, for they wore
                    none to their lips; in which they essentially differ from their American
                    neighbours.</p>
                <p>Their clothing consisted of a cap, a frock, a pair of breeches, a pair of boots,
                    and a pair of gloves, all made of the skins of deer, dogs, seals, &amp;c.
                    extremely well dressed; some with the hair or fur on, and others without. The
                    caps were made to fit the head very close; and, besides these caps, which most
                    of them wore, we got from them some hoods made of the skins of dogs, large
                    enough to cover both head and shoulders. Their hair seemed to be black, but
                    their heads were either shaved, or the hair cut close off, and none of them wore
                    any beard. Of the articles they got from us, knives and tobacco they valued
                    most.</p>
                <p>We found the village composed both of their summer and their winter habitations.
                    The latter are exactly like vaults, the floors of which are sunk a little below
                    the surface of the earth, and boarded, and under them a kind of cellar, in which
                    we saw nothing but water. At the end of each house was a vaulted room, which we
                    took to be a store-room. Over it stood a kind of sentry-box or tower, composed
                    of the large bones of large fish.</p>
                <p>The summer-huts were pretty large and conical. The framing was of light poles and
                    bones, covered <pb n="260"/> with the skins of sea-animals. We examined the
                    inside of one. There was a fire-place just within the door, near which lay a few
                    wooden vessels, all very dirty. Their bed-places were close to the sides. Some
                    privicies seemed to be observed, for there were several partitions made of
                    skins. The bed and bedding were of deer-skins, and most of them were dry and
                    clean.</p>
                <p>About these habitations were several stages, ten or twelve feet high, for drying
                    their fish and skins out of the reach of their dogs, of which they had many;
                    large and of different colours, with long soft hair, like wool; probably used in
                    drawing the sledges, for sledges they had in their huts. Perhaps these dogs,
                    being numerous, may constitute a part of their food; for several of them lay
                    dead, that had been killed that morning.</p>
                <p>Their canoes are of the same sort with those of the Northern Americans.</p>
                <p>By the large fish-bones, and of other sea-animals, that lay scattered about, it
                    appears, that the sea supplies them with the greatest part of their
                    substance.</p>
                <p>After a stay of about two or three hours with these people, we returned to our
                    ships, and pur+sued our voyage.</p>
                <p>On the 11th we passed several large islands to the eastward of us, and at the
                    same time left the extreme point of the northern cape of Asia, which we saw
                    trend away to the W. by S. as far as the eye could carry, mostly high land,
                    barren and covered with snow. We then bore away to the north-east, sounding
                    from 5 to 6 fathom, and about 3 P. M. finding the sea to change of a milky
                    colour, and at the same time to shallow very fast, we came to in 7 fathom water,
                    and sent the boats out to sound, who soon returned, finding <pb n="261"/> the
                    sea to deepen as they proceeded. We then got under way, standing all night N.
                    one half W. passing in the night several large sea cows and other sea monsters.
                    Lat. 66.5. long. 191.19.</p>
                <p>On the 12th we altered our course, and stood to the westward, when both ships
                    tacked, and plyed to the North, leaving two very small islands on our starboard
                    bow. In the evening we crossed the arctic circle, and stood all night W. by S.
                    66.35. long 189.39.</p>
                <p>In the morning of the 13th we stood once more north eastward. We were now in lat
                    66.40. and from 20 to 40 fathom water, the weather warm and fine. We altered our
                    course and steered all night N. N. E.</p>
                <p>On the 14th in the morning, we hauled our wind and stood with the ship's head to
                    the N. E. About 5 in the afternoon we came in sight of land, distance about 5 or
                    6 leagues, very high, woody, and covered with snow; we stood in for land; but
                    finding the coast rugged, and the water shoal, we stood again W. S. W. and
                    continued that course the whole night. Lat. 67.27. long. 191.40.</p>
                <p>On the 15th, finding ourselves attacked by a heavy storm of wind, attended with
                    rain, we bore away N. W. by W. and continued that course till the evening, when
                    we shortened sail and stood to the southward. Lat. obs. 68.18. long. 192.37.</p>
                <p>On the 16th at noon we found ourselves in lat. 69.46. long. 192. E. We then stood
                    from N. N. E. to N. E. sounding from 22 to 23 fathom water. Lat. 69.46. long.
                    192.</p>
                <p>On the 17th the weather began to grow pierceing cold. The frost set in, and
                    froze so hard that the running rigging was soon loaded with ice, and rendered
                    almost impossible to make the sheafs or <pb n="262"/> blocks traverse without
                    the assistance of six men to do the work of one. But what was most remarkable,
                    was the sudden transition from heat to such severe cold. The day before was warm
                    and pleasant, but in the evening of this day the ice was seen hanging at our
                    hair, our noses, and even at the men's fingers ends, if they did but expose them
                    to the air for five or six minutes: and still the farther they ran to the
                    eastward, the colder it grew, and the ice the more connected. About 2 in the
                    afternoon we found ourselves surrounded with large floating islands of ice,
                    which, like clouds in the sky, were continually varying their appearances; but
                    the farther we ran to the eastward, the closer the ice became compacted. As the
                    weather was now clear, though piercing cold, we could see the ice extending on
                    every side E. and W. as far as the eye could carry. We stood to the northward,
                    and being embayed, we observed a large island floating, with the tide towards
                    us, whereon was supposed to rest great numbers of sea-monsters. Being
                    apprehensive of danger, the signal was made for tacking. We kept off and on all
                    night. Lat. 70.41. long. 197.</p>
                <p>On the 18th, hot victuals froze while we were at table; and this weather
                    continued for some days. Being now well in with the ice, and having lost sight
                    of land, we kept working to the westward. At noon a great fog came on, but soon
                    clearing up, the sun made his appearance, and we had an observation, by which we
                    found we were in lat. 70.54. long. 198.17. About eight at night it blew a gale,
                    with heavy snow; we shortened sail, and stood to the southward.</p>
                <p>The 19th when looking round in the morning, as soon as the fog cleared away, we
                    saw nothing but fields of ice covered with whole herds of sea-lions, <pb n="263"
                    /> sea-horses, and other amphibious animals, to the number, as it was thought,
                    of some thousands. Thus surrounded, a signal was made from the Resolution to
                    bring to, and to load the great guns, while the boats were getting ready to
                    attack these hideous looking creatures with muskets. This, by the sailors from
                    both ships, was accounted sport; and they went to the attack with as much
                    alacrity as if to a match at foot-ball. Orders were given, as soon as the great
                    guns were discharged, to quicken the attack with the musketry as fast as
                    possible. In a few minutes not a creature was to be seen upon the ice but such
                    as were killed, or so severely wounded as not to be able to crawl to the open
                    sea. Some lay growling on the ice not quite dead, with two or three balls
                    through their heads, and others tumbling about with horrible vindictive looks,
                    threatening destruction to whoever should approach them. These monsters, when
                    at their growth, are in length from the head to the hindmost fin from eleven to
                    twelve feet; round the belly from twenty to twenty-six feet. Four long stiff
                    fins serve them for feet, with which they crawl or slide upon the ice, and move
                    with wonderful agility; two large tusks, at the distance of 7 or 8 inches apart,
                    project from the nostrils, in length from twenty inches to two feet four, thick
                    at the root, and tapering to a point; their forehead resembles that of a bull.
                    They have whiskers on each side the mouth, about six inches long, as stiff as a
                    knitting-needle, with which they raise themselves upon the ice. Their eyes are
                    small. They have no teeth; nor have they any tail. They have, like the seals,
                    some little hair upon their skins, but very thin; and are, upon the whole, most
                    horribly ugly creatures. After the engagement was over, all hands were employed
                        <pb n="264"/> to collect the carcasses, and to carry them on board; but what
                    was thought an ill reward for their labour, orders were next day given by Capt.
                    Cook to substitute the flesh of these sea-monsters in the room of all other
                    provisions, bread or flour only excepted. This was strongly opposed by the crew
                    of the Resolution, and Capt. Clerke remonstrated against it. He was told by
                    Capt. Cook, that he might do as he pleased on board his own ship; but the state
                    of the provisions on board the Resolution made it necessary, and that he himself
                    should set the example. Capt. Clerke endeavoured, but in vain, to enforce the
                    order, and the matter passed on without any serious consequences.</p>
                <p>On the 20th we tacked ship, and stood to the westward, the wind much against us.
                    We tacked every two hours, still working over to the Asiatic shore, with a view
                    to examine the coasts on both sides, before we returned to the southward. We
                    were now in lat. 70.54. long. 194.55.</p>
                <p>On the 21st, we came in sight of the continent of America, extending from S. by
                    E. to E. by S. the nearest part five leagues distant.</p>
                <p> We continued labouring among the ice till the 25th, when a storm came on, which
                    made it dangerous for us to proceed; a consultation was therefore held on
                    board the Resolution as soon as the violence of the gale abated, when it was
                    unanimously resolved, that as this passage was impracticable for any useful
                    purpose of navigation, which was the great object of the voyage, to pursue it no
                    farther, especially in the condition the ships were in, the winter approaching,
                    and the distance from any known place of refreshment great.</p>
                <p>About two in the morning of the 26th we observed a great body of ice nearing us
                    very fast, and in a few hours after we saw the ice all closed as far <pb n="265"
                    /> as the eye could carry, bearing from N. E. to S. W. We continued to sail W.
                    S. W.</p>
                <p>On the 28th several pieces of loose ice passed us, one of which came soul of the
                    Discovery, and shook her whole frame; it was feared she had received
                    considerable damage, but upon the carpenters examining her sore and aft,
                    nothing was found amiss. We now took leave of the ice for this season,
                    directing our course S. S. W.</p>
                <p>On the 29th we saw land in the morning, which bore from N. N. W. to S. W. very
                    high, and covered with snow. At two, P. M. we were in with the land. It showed
                    itself in two hills, like islands; but afterwards seemed connected, and appeared
                    in every respect like the opposite coast of America. In the low ground, lying
                    between the high land and the sea, was a lake, extending to the S. E. farther
                    than we could see.</p>
                <p>The 30th, at two, A. M. bore away E. by S. At seven saw land; the extreme of
                    which bore S. E. At two, P. M. saw more land, trending to the southward. At this
                    time came in sight of a narrow channel that seemed to lead to the lake, which we
                    had seen the day before. H••…led our wind, and stood N. E. by E. In the evening
                    we were in with the land, and not a shrub to be seen, but birds innumerable,
                    chiefly sea parrots.</p>
                <p>On the 31st, at day-light, we came in sight of the eastern cape, named Cape
                    North, bearing S. S. E. very high, and covered with snow: we were then distant
                    from the nearest shore four or five leagues. Continued our course from S. S. E.
                    to S. E. by E. At noon the extreme of the southward point bore S. W. by S. At
                    three, P. M. we saw two small, but very high islands, bearing from N. N. E. to
                    N. W. which we left to the northward. We were then in lat. 68.56. and <pb
                        n="266"/> long. 180.51. At night both ships tacked to the westward. This day
                    we passed an island, to which Capt. Cook gave the name of Burney's Island.</p>
                <p>Sept. 1, we continued coasting to the eastward, as the land trended; distance
                    about four miles from the shore. Here Capt. Cook took occasion to fix the
                    Eastern point of the Asiatic Continent. It shews, he says, a steep rocky cliff
                    facing the sea, and lies in the lat. 67.3. and long. 188.11.</p>
                <p>On the 2d we continued coasting along shore. Course all day S. S. E. Saw many
                    very high trees, supposed to be pines.</p>
                <p> On the 3d we opened into the great bay, called the bay of St. Lawrence, where we
                    anchored the 10th of last month; but what was remarkable, none of the
                    inhabitants, whom we had visited, offered to approach us, though the weather
                    was favourable.</p>
                <p>On the 4th stood W. N. W. right in for the land. At six, A. M. bore away S. ½ W.
                    the easternmost point of land bearing S. by E. distance six or seven leagues,
                    and so continued all day. At night stood E. N. E.</p>
                <p>On the 5th we lost sight of the main continent of Asia, which we left the day
                    before. Lat. 64.7. long. 189.1.</p>
                <p>On the 6th we saw land from W. N. W. to E. N. E. very woody, and covered with
                    snow in the vallies. Here we found ourselves in sight of Sledge-Island, near the
                    continent of America; and here Capt. Cook was desirous of discovering the island
                    of Alaschkska, which the Russians had described as abounding with wood and
                    water.</p>
                <p>On the 7th, there came two canoes from the shore, with four Indians in them,
                    though we were distant full four leagues. We hove to for their <pb n="267"/>
                    coming up; but when along-side, they had little or nothing to part with, except
                    some dried fish. They were invited on board, but could not be persuaded to
                    enter. The Captain made them presents of some trifles, with which they departed
                    well pleased. They were clothed in skins, after the manner of all the
                    inhabitants of the Western coasts of America, among whom we found a remarkable
                    uniformity of dress and colour.</p>
                <p>On the 8th, we steered E. ½ N. passing several bays and fine harbours all day;
                    found the country pleasant, and the coast delightful. Lat. 64.22. long. 197.
                    beyond which the coast took a more Northerly course. Here we found a strong
                    current to set to the S. E. at the rate of five knots an hour.</p>
                <p>On the 9th, at five, A. M. land appeared from S. E. to E. like two islands, but,
                    after fatigueing trials, we found them join to the main land. At four, P. M.
                    the land opened all round, from one shore to the other; and we found ourselves
                    in the middle of a deep bay, but very shallow, sometimes three, but never above
                    five fathoms and a half water. At this time, a head-land on the West shore,
                    distinguished by the name of Bald Head, lay N. by W. one league distant. We saw
                    the bay to run as far as the eye could carry, but impossible to proceed, as in
                    many places the water shallowed under three fathom. We stood off and on all
                    night.</p>
                <p>On the 10th, having a stiff breeze, we ran right across the mouth of the bay, for
                    the N. W. shore, and just before night the Resolution narrowly escaped running
                    upon a rock. This day, Capt. Cook landed on a narrow border of land which joined
                    to the beech, and which was covered with grass and heath, with a variety of wild
                    berries, <pb n="268"/> but rather over-ripe. He observed traces of foxes and
                    deer upon the beech, but none were caught; on each side of this peninsula the
                    coast forms a bay. The projecting point of this peninsula, obtained the name of
                    Cape Denbeigh. Several natives were seen on the peninsula, and one came off, to
                    whom Capt. Cook gave a knife, and asked him for something to eat. The man
                    paddled off; and meeting with another man, with two dried salmon in his canoe,
                    took them from him, and brought them to the Captain.</p>
                <p>On the 11th, we came to anchor, in six fathom water, distance from the shore
                    about four miles; the Easternmost point of the bay bearing N. E. by E. distance
                    about eight miles, very high land. In the night, we saw several fires, but no
                    Indians came off to us.</p>
                <p>On the 12th, in the morning, the boats from both ships were sent on shore, where
                    they saw some houses of a wretched construction; a small sledge, and several
                    other articles belonging to the Indians, but none of the natives. About ten,
                    they returned with a load of wood, which they found drifted on the beech, but
                    no water; the wood had drifted from the Southward, for we saw no trees, but
                    black spruce. We then stretched over to the other shore, and the boats were
                    again sent out, and about nine in the evening returned, loaded with wood, which
                    the men were obliged to carry through the water on their shoulders, as the boats
                    could not come within half a mile of land, for breakers. This was a grievous
                    task, as many of them but just recovered their late illness. This day several
                    natives came from the S. S. E. side, in large canoes, having great quantities of
                    salmon, dried and fresh, which they exchanged for blue and red beads, needles,
                    pins, knives, or scissars, <pb n="269"/> or any European trinkets that were
                    offered them; but what they valued most was tobacco. For this they would
                    exchange their bows and arrows, their warlike instruments, and whatever else
                    they valued most; but of this commodity, as has already been noticed, we had but
                    little to spare. We were again obliged to change our station, and stretch to the
                    other shore, where a safe anchorage was discovered, near which we could get wood
                    and water with the greatest ease. We now stood more to the Southward, in order
                    to avoid those breakers we so narrowly escaped before; and next day our great
                    cutter was sent out, properly provided with a compass, and six days provision,
                    to survey the bay, with a view to determine whether that land to which the
                    Russians have given the name of Alaskah, joined to the American continent, or
                    whether there was not a passage through the bay to the Northward. While the
                    cutters were on this service, the boats continued wooding and watering, and
                    before the return of the former, the latter had got the full complement of both
                    on board, and the ships were in readiness to depart.</p>
                <p>The 13th, cast anchor in four fathoms and a half water, within a mile and a half
                    from the mouth of a great river, from whence before night we had got more than
                    20 tons of water; we had likewise got a considerable quantity of wood from the
                    shore. This day a family of the natives came near the place where we were taking
                    off the wood, miserable looking objects, who for four knives made out of an iron
                    hoop, parted with more than 400 lb. weight of fish, which they had caught this
                    and the preceding day.</p>
                <p>On the 14th, the men had leave to go ashore by turns to gather berries, which
                    they now found ripe, and in great abundance, such as rasberries, <pb n="270"/>
                    blue-berries, black and red currants, huckle berries, with various other sorts,
                    all in full perfection. A party was likewise sent out to cut spruce, to brew
                    into beer for both ships. Of this liquor, however, the men were not very fond in
                    this cold climate, especially when they were given to understand that their
                    grog was to be stopped, and this beer substituted in the room of it. This
                    occasioned great murmuring, and it was found necessary to give it alternately,
                    spruce one day, and grog another.</p>
                <p>On their excursions, the parties were always well armed, and had marines to
                    attend them; and their orders were never to go out of hearing of the ships guns,
                    but to repair instantly on board on the proper signals. These precautions,
                    however, seemed unnecessary, as they never met with any molestation from the
                    natives, who were not numerous upon the coast.</p>
                <p>On the 17th, the party that were sent out to survey the bay returned, after a
                    diligent examination of two days and two nights. Their report was, that from
                    the elevated spot from which they had taken their survey, they could see the
                    inlet terminate in a considerable river, which emptied itself into the sea at
                    the head of the bay; that in its course it watered many most delightful vallies,
                    which were bounded on every side with hills of a moderate height, interspersed
                    with mountains or a stupendous height. This report being confirmed by the
                    officers who commanded the cutters from both ships, the boats were all taken on
                    board and secured, and wood and water having been plentifully supplied, the bay
                    and sound examined, and the exact situation determined to be lat. 64.31. and
                    long. 197.13. there remained nothing but to name the sound, and take our
                        leave.<pb n="271"/> In honour of Sir Fletcher Norton, then Speaker of the
                    House of Commons, to whom Lieut. King had the honour to be nearly related, it
                    was named Norton Sound, called by the natives Chacktoole.</p>
                <p>On the 18th, we weighed and sailed, retracing Beering's Straits, which we had
                    before explored, without any material accident, though we found the water to
                    shallow, insomuch that we were forced to abandon the thoughts of passing between
                    Besborough Island and the main, to more than six miles distance.</p>
                <p>On the 19th, shoal water obliged us to haul to the Westward, by which the whole
                    coast from 63 to 60 remains unexplored; within which, from several indications,
                    it should seem that a considerable river runs into the sea.</p>
                <p>On the 20th, about two P. M. we came in sight of land, which appeared like two
                    islands. Lat. 63.19. and at six in the evening came up with it, but found both
                    islands in one, without either bush or tree. Course S. W.</p>
                <p>On the 21st, saw a great number of islands; but they too, when we approached
                    them, appeared all in one. Lat. 62.56. Course S. S. W.</p>
                <p>On the 24th, we met with a dreadful tempest of wind, rain, and hail, or rather
                    ice, between two and three inches square, by which several of our men, who were
                    obliged to keep the deck, were severely wounded. In this long run, we passed
                    several remarkable promontaries and islands, particularly in lat. 63.30. N. we
                    passed two head-lands, distance from each other about half a mile. We hove-to,
                    and our boats sounded across, in some places not above one fathom and a half. In
                    lat. 62.56. we came in sight of a cluster of islands, as we imagined; but on our
                    nearer approach, found them all in one, barren, and without a <pb n="272"/>
                    shrub or tree. In lat. 60.12. we came up with a stupendous rock or high island,
                    almost covered with snow, and without any other inhabitants except birds and
                    seals; to this last Capt. Cook gave the name of Winter Island, from its dreary
                    appearance.</p>
                <p>On the 26th, the Resolution made the signal of distress. On hailing her we were
                    informed, that she had again sprung a leak in the late violent gale, and that
                    all hands were employed at the pumps and in baleing; and that it was with
                    difficulty they could keep her above water. Lat. 58.39.</p>
                <p>On the 29th, we were again visited with a severe storm, and involved in heavy
                    seas, our hull being sometimes entirely under water, and the waves rising to the
                    yard-arms. About midnight it came on to snow, and the Resolution kept making
                    signals and firing guns all night. At day-light, we saw her distant five or six
                    miles. We shortened sail, and waited for her coming up. And, On the 30th, being
                    both in company, the storm abated and the sea quite calm, both ships hove-to,
                    and, while the carpenters were employed in stopping the leak in the Resolution,
                    the people were busied in fishing. Those on board the Discovery caught 40 large
                    cod, besides turbot, which were the more acceptable to officers and men, as our
                    salt provisions were now very bad. Lat. 56.30. N.</p>
                <p>On the 1st of October, we continued our course to the Southward. Lat. obs. 55.27.
                    And On the 2d, about five in the morning, we made land; and hauled our wind in
                    search of Samganoodo Harbour, on the island of Oomalashka, of which we had
                    mistaken the entrance. About six in the evening we came in sight of a large
                    Indian <pb n="273"/> town in a deep bay, where we found ourselves surrounded
                    with whales of a prodigious size. We sounded, and found no bottom at 100
                    fathoms. Here some of our former friends came off to us, and being informed that
                    our design was to anchor in our late harbour, they undertook to be our pilots,
                    and one of them slept all night on board the Discovery.</p>
                <p>On the 3d, in the morning, we found ourselves right a-breast the Race, and saw
                    the Resolution just within the entrance. About two in the afternoon, the wind
                    and tide both uniting in our favour, we safely anchored in our late birth.</p>
                <p>All hands were now set to work, the carpenters in stripping the sheathing from
                    the Resolution to examine her leaks, and the sail-makers, caulkers, and riggers,
                    in their respective employments, for which there was great need, both ships
                    having suffered much in their sails, seams, and rigging, in the late tempestuous
                    weather, and in the icy Northern seas; but what gave the greatest pleasure to
                    the seamen, was the success they met with in fishing, whenever the weather was
                    such as to suffer them to haul the seine. At the mouth of the harbour, they
                    could at any time, in three or four hours, fill their boats with holybut of an
                    enormous size; one of them, sent on board the Resolution, during our stay,
                    weighed 220 lb.—Each mess had now a small cask with a quantity of salt given
                    them, in order to make some provision to help out their short allowance, which
                    it was found necessary to continue till their arrival in the tropical islands,
                    where the ships might again be furnished with a frefh supply. On the 4th, our
                    Captain went on board the Commodore, where he was acquainted by Capt. Cook with
                    the distress of the Resolution, which <pb n="274"/> ever since the hard gale on
                    the 26th had been ready to founder; on that day, on sounding the pumps, three
                    feet water were found in the well; and judging the leak to proceed from the same
                    place as before, the carpenters were employed in search of it, when, to their
                    great surprize, they found the full casks afloat, and great quantities of
                    provisions utterly spoilt. Their first care was to skuttle the bulk-heads, and
                    to let the water down into the hold, and then the pumps were kept constantly at
                    work to pump it out; but this was beyond their power; they could gain but little
                    with incessant labour, and when they came into harbour had 28 inches still in
                    the hold. The carpenters had already stript the sides of the Resolution 16 feet
                    from the counter forwards, where they found the inside timbers so much decayed,
                    that their report was, if their continuance at sea had been necessarily
                    protracted a fortnight longer, she must have gone to the bottom.</p>
                <p>We had still much to do, our articles for the tropical trade were nearly all
                    exchanged, and we could expect no supplies of provisions without an equivalent.
                    We therefore sent a small spare bower anchor on shore, and set our armourers to
                    break it up, and make it into spikes, axes, hatchets, nails, and other tropical
                    merchandize.</p>
                <p>While every thing was getting ready, the officers diverted themselves as usual
                    with shooting and surveying the country; and here they found amusement enough,
                    having discovered a Russian settlement, divided only by a neck of land about 15
                    miles over, and a bay of about 1• miles, which they had to cross. From this
                    settlement Capt. Cook received a very singular pre+sent. It was a rye-loaf, or
                    rather a pye, inclosing some salmon very nicely seasoned. The man who <pb
                        n="275"/> brought it was named Derramoushk, and brought likewise a present
                    for Capt. Clerke. These came from some Russian gentlemen settled in that
                    neighbourhood. In return some bottles of rum, wine and porter were sent back by
                    the same hand; and Corporal Lediard of the marines, a very intelligent person,
                    sent to gain information, who soon returned with three Russian seamen and
                    furriers, who, when they first discovered us at a distance from the shore, were
                    apprehensive that we were Japanese, with whom their nation was at war; but on
                    our nearer approach, they were convinced from the trim of our ships that we were
                    strangers; they were therefore encouraged, by the report of the natives, to make
                    themselves known, and to offer their assistance as far as lay in their power.
                    These were received with open arms; generously entertained, and a very friendly
                    intercourse established.</p>
                <p>The road across the neck of land was rather rugged, but when that was surmounted,
                    the communication was easy. Some of our gentlemen who went to return the visit,
                    were met by an officer, who received them politely, and directed them to the
                    factory, where, besides the fort, they found a Russian bark of about 50 or 60
                    tons, eight small swivels, and one three pounder laid up for the winter, and
                    intended for Kamsha•ska the ensuing summer. Our gentlemen were here shewn the
                    stores belonging to the factory, consisting of skins and oil; their coppers for
                    boiling the oil, with the small ware with which they trafficked with the
                    natives by way of exchange. Iron instruments of war are prohibited, nor do they
                    suffer any offensive weapons of any kind to be introduced among them. It is
                    probable therefore, that the long knives we saw in the possession of the more
                    southerly Indians, were some that were <pb n="276"/> taken from those
                    unfortunate Russians, who, on the first discovery of this continent, fell a
                    sacrifice to the savage barbarity of the natives. It was a little unfortunate,
                    that we had not one person on board either ship that had the most distant
                    knowledge of the Russ language; every thing was to be understood by signs. Our
                    officers could just make out, that a Russian Captain had been murdered by the
                    natives, and that the Russians had taken a severe revenge, and had laid the
                    country under contribution, and obliged the inhabitants to pay a certain
                    annual tribute in skins; but to what extent they had subdued the country, or in
                    what year, they could not at all understand. They learnt, that the name of the
                    island was Noo-Oonalashkah, in lat. 53.55. long. 167.30. E. of Greenwich; that
                    they had another settlement to the Southward, and other vessels that were
                    constantly employed in trading with the natives, and collecting their skins and
                    oil; that the factory was supposed to clear about 100,000 rubles annually by
                    this trade; and that it was increasing; that their only guard consisted of
                    about 40 Kamshatskadale Russians, and 300 natives, over whom they were obliged
                    to keep a watchful eye. Our gentlemen's entertainment there was rather friendly
                    than sumptuous; they had dried venison, dried salmon, and great variety of other
                    fish, dressed after the Russian manner; their biscuit was black, and their bread
                    rye; their butter not extraordinary; their wine and brandy, the Indians who
                    conducted the gentlemen earned, from the ships, with which the Russian officers
                    made very free. The evening; being spent in mutual enquiries, by which neither
                    side could receive much satisfaction, they were shewn to the apartments
                    prepared for them, where they slept undisturbed.</p>
                <pb n="277"/>
                <p>In the morning they renewed their enquiries, and the Russians, by exhibiting the
                    chart of their discoveries and conquests, gave our gentlemen more satisfactory
                    information than they could otherwise have obtained. They observed a remarkable
                    conformity between those charts exhibited by the Russians as far as they went,
                    and their own. The Russian discoveries extended from the 49th to the 64th degree
                    of Northern latitude, by which the impracticability which we had discovered of a
                    North-west passage by any strait or sound was fully confirmed.</p>
                <p>They were now equally communicative to each other; the Russian gentlemen were
                    desirous of knowing the names of the navigators and ships, with the expedition
                    they were engaged in; and they were invited on board to receive further
                    information. To this they readily agreed; and as soon as our gentlemen had
                    satisfied their curiosity; had visited the Russian houses, which were built with
                    timber, and those of the natives built with poles and earth; had remarked the
                    simplicity of the latter, which seemed but one degree above the level of the
                    beavers they hunted; and of the former, that was little more than a degree
                    above those of the natives; they set out upon their return to the ships,
                    accompanied by the Russian gentlemen, by whom they had been entertained.</p>
                <p>About five in the evening, they all came on board the Resolution: the Russian
                    gentlemen were received by Capt. Cook with that familiarity and politeness that
                    was natural to him; they were taken into the great cabin, where both Captains
                    with their principal officers and gentlemen were assembled to entertain them,
                    and where the bottle was pretty briskly pushed about, <pb n="278"/> as that was
                    the principal subject in which the strangers could bear a part. Here they were
                    interrogated as to the time generally taken up in making the voyage to
                    Kamshatska, which they answered, by dividing the year into twelve parts, and
                    pointing to the two middlemost. As the master of the vessel which lay at
                    Aegoochskach was of the company, he was asked at what time he expected to arrive
                    at Kamshatska. He answered about the 9th month, meaning in July. He was then
                    requested to take letters with him to be forwarded to England through Russia,
                    should it so happen that he should arrive at that port before us. This charge he
                    readily undertook; and, being pretty well plied with liquor, they slept on board
                    the Resolution, and next day came on board the Discovery, where they dined, and,
                    being amply supplied with grog, went jovially away in the afternoon.</p>
                <p>Before our departure, we were visited by the Principal of the Russian factory,
                    whose name was Erasim Gergorioffzin Izmyloff. He came from the Southward,
                    accompanied by a number of Indian canoes, laden with skins, who on coming
                    ashore in the harbour, instantly began erecting a tent, which in half an hour
                    they finished, covering it with skins. He was received on board the Resolution
                    with the respect due to his rank; and by his deportment it was easy to perceive
                    that he was of family. He was a young gentleman of a fair complexion, and
                    graceful stature, and, though differing but little in point of dress from those
                    by whom we had been visited before, he was, notwithstanding, very different in
                    his manners and behaviour. He had travelled much, but chiefly in these savage
                    countries, and in the Northern parts of Asia, and understood, and could talk the
                        <pb n="279"/> language of the natives, but could speak no European language,
                    except his own. He was handsomely entertained on board both ships, and had every
                    attention paid him that, in our situation, he had reason to expect; nor was he
                    insensible of our civilities. He wrote a letter, directed to the Governor of
                    Kamshatska, which he requested Capt. Cook to deliver. It contained, as we
                    afterwards understood, a detail of his own mercantile affairs, and a
                    representation of us, as trading with the Indians. He told us, that his
                    residence was on the coast, off which he had received a note in a little box,
                    and that he was the person who wrote that note and sent it. Some presents
                    reciprocally passed: those on his part were cloaks and skins; on ours, tobacco
                    and spirituous liquors, of both which we observed the Russians to be
                    immoderately fond.</p>
                <p>After sleeping on board the ships two nights, and observing, with an attentive
                    eye, the different employments of the artificers, and examining the various
                    conveniencies and accommodations which we had on board, he took his leave on
                    the 26th, intending to make some stay at the settlement of Egooschac, which the
                    gentlemen of the Resolution had just visited.</p>
                <p>From this gentleman Capt. Cook received much useful information. He had some
                    excellent maps and charts of the Northern coasts and islands, which never had
                    been published, but which had every mark of authenticity. He said, there were
                    only two harbours on the peninsula of Kamtschatka that were fit to receive ships
                    of burden; the bay of Awatska and the river Olutora: as to the many islands to
                    the North of Kamtschatka, lying between that and the coasts of America, which
                    had found place in former maps, Page 280 were wholly omitted and others added,
                    by which the Captain was enabled to compleat his own. From the information given
                    by this gentleman, we have been able to correct our own map prefixed to this
                    voyage, with respect to the situation of islands between the Bay of Awatska, and
                    the country of Alascha, the name by which the continent of this part of America
                    is known to the Russians, and called by the natives.</p>
                <p>There are, it seems, Russians settled on all the principal islands between
                    Oonalashka and Kamtschatka, for the purpose of collecting furs. Their great
                    object is the sea-beaver or otter. The natives are a quiet inoffensive people,
                    and for honesty might serve as an example to the most enlightened people upon
                    earth. The latitude of Saganoodha harbour is 53.5. longitude 193.11.</p>
                <p>On the 25th, the repairs of both ships being compleated, and the wind coming fair
                    to the Southward, we unmoored and were preparing to sail, when the Resolution,
                    on clearing the harbour, run upon a rock, and, it was feared, had received much
                    damage, as at low water she swayed 13 inches, and it was twelve at night before
                    she was disengaged. This necessarily retarded our departure; and happily it was
                    that we were got safe into harbour, for a storm arose, which tumbled the waters
                    into the race with unexampled fury.</p>
                <p>On the 26th, the wind abated and came fair to carry us to sea, and the ship being
                    found unhurt, we weighed, and, having cleared the harbour, made sail, directing
                    our course up the race, to the N. W. At eight o'clock we were out of the race,
                    but still continued our course to the Westward, when at midnight a heavy gale
                    came on attended with snow and rain.</p>
                <pb n="281"/>
                <p>On the 27th, the gale still continuing, to add to our labour, we sprung a leak,
                    which kept us to the pumps till the storm abated. While it was at the height, it
                    carried away our fore and maintacks, and, in endeavouring to save them, John
                    Mackintosh, seaman, was struck dead, and the boatswain and four men were much
                    wounded.</p>
                <p>On the 28th, having lost sight of the Resolution in the heavy gale, about three
                    in the morning we heard her signal for wearing. Lat. 53.52.</p>
                <p>On the 29th, about eight A. M. we again saw land, supposed to be the island
                    called Amoghta, and by ten were in danger of perishing on a lee-shore. At
                    eleven our people in taking in a reef of the fore-top-sail, called out a ship
                    under sail, bearing N. N. W. but on a nearer view found it an elevated rock
                    covered with snow. Lat. 53.57. long. 191.192.</p>
                <p>On the 30th, we were again within the race, and at six in the evening passed the
                    entrance of our harbour, when five canoes made towards us; but being now in full
                    sail, intending to leave the coast, our leak not being found dangerous, they
                    were unable to overtake us, nor did we think it of consequence to lie bye till
                    they should come up. On the 31st, we pursued our course to the Southward. Lat.
                    52.3.</p>
                <p>On the 1st of November, we once more stood to the Southward, after which no
                    accident, or any thing worth relating happened, till our arrival on the coast
                    of O-why-e, so called by the Russians, and by Capt. Cook Providence harbour,
                    except that on the 7th a cormorant was seen to fly several times round the
                    Resolution; which was the more noticed as those birds are never seen far from
                    land, and none was near.</p>
                <pb n="282"/>
                <p>On the 26th, being then in lat. 21.15. about six A. M. we came in sight of land,
                    bearing from S. S. W. to N. W. very high and beautiful; we were then so much in
                    want of provisions, that Capt. Clerke, much against his inclination, was under
                    the necessity of substituting stock-fish in the room of beef; but we were no
                    sooner well in with the land, than we were visited by many of the inhabitants,
                    who came off with their canoes with all sorts of provisions which their island
                    afforded; and every man on board, had leave to purchase what he could for his
                    own subsistence. This diffused a joy among the mariners that is not easy to be
                    expressed. From a sullenness and discontent visible in every countenance the day
                    before, all was chearfulness, mirth and jollity. Fresh provisions and kind
                    damsels are the sailors sole delight; and when in possession of these, past
                    hardships are instantly forgotten: even those whom the scurvy had attacked, and
                    had rendered pale and lifeless as ghosts, brightened upon this occasion, and for
                    the moment appeared alert. This flattering beginning, however, yielded no
                    substantial relief. The boats that were sent to sound the shore, and to look
                    for a harbour, went out day after day, without being able to discover so much as
                    a safe anchorage, and we were longer in finding a harbour than in making the
                    coast. Nothing could be more toilsome or distressing than our present situation;
                    within sight of land, yet unable to reach it; driven out to sea, by one storm,
                    and in danger of being wrecked on the breakers by another. At length, after
                    having examined the leeward side of the island, Captain Cook made the signal to
                    stand out to sea. This was on the 7th of December, when it was determined <pb
                        n="283"/> to take a long stretch, in order, if possible, to get round the
                    S. E. extremity, and to examine the weathermost side, where we were told there
                    was a safe harbour. In this attempt we split our main-top-mast-stay-sail, and
                    lost sight of the Resolution. The weather continuing tempestuous for many days,
                    heavy complaints again prevailed among the ship's company. Their sufferings,
                    from incessant labour and scanty provisions, were grown confessedly grievous.
                    Their grog, that had been stopped as soon as we arrived upon the coast, was
                    again dealt out to them as usual; and it was with the kindest treatment from
                    their officers, that the men could be kept to their duty; yet on Christmas-day,
                    when each man was allowed a pint of brandy, and free leave to enjoy himself as
                    he liked, not a murmur was heard; they the very next day returned to business,
                    and continued it without repining, till The 16th of January, 1779, when, after a
                    series of the most tempestuous weather that ever happened in that climate, the
                    boats from both ships were sent out to examine a fine bay, where we were
                    informed there was a harbour in which we might safely moor, and where we should
                    be supplied with materials to refit the ships, and provisions to victual them.
                    In the evening the boats returned with the joyful news, that they had succeeded
                    in their search, and that the harbour promised fair to answer all that had been
                    said of it.</p>
                <p>On the 17th our boats were employed in towing the ships into harbour in sight of
                    the greatest multitude of Indian spectators in canoes and on shore, that we had
                    ever seen assembled together in any part of our voyage. It was concluded, <pb
                        n="284"/> that their number could not be less than 2 or 3000. While we were
                    hovering upon the coast, we had often been visited by 200 canoes at a time, who
                    came to trade, and who brought us provisions when the weather would permit; and,
                    besides provisions, they brought us great quantities of cordage, salt, and other
                    manufactures of the island, which the Captains purchased for the use of the
                    ships, and without which we could not have subsisted; for during the tempestuous
                    weather our cordage snapped rope after rope, so that our spare hands were
                    incessantly employed, night and day, in knotting and splicing, of which there
                    was no end.</p>
                <p>This day, before two o'clock, P. M. we were safely moored in 17 fathom water, in
                    company with the Resolution, which a few days before we had given over for lost.
                    From the time of attempting to get round the island, till the 8th of January,
                    we had never been able to get sight of her, though both ships were constantly
                    looking out to find each other. They had suffered much in their masts and
                    rigging, and were happy at last, as well as ourselves, to find a convenient
                    harbour to refit. We were scarce moored, when a young man, of majestic
                    appearance, came along side, and after an oration, and the usual ceremonies of
                    peace had passsed on both sides, he came on board, bringing with him a small
                    barbecued hog, some ready-dressed bread-fruit, and a curious mantle of red
                    cloth, as presents to the Captain; and in return was complimented with several
                    axes, looking-glasses, bracelets, and other shewy articles that attracted his
                    notice. While he was busy in admiring every thing he saw on board the
                    Discovery, the pinnace was ordered out, and he with his attendants were taken
                    to Capt. Cook, where he <pb n="285"/> found another Chief, of a still more
                    graceful aspect, named Kaneena. All these were received with all possible
                    respect. In the mean time came in another Chief, named Koah, who was soon
                    discovered to be a priest; but who, in his youth, had been a distinguished
                    warrior. After entertaining them with music, and inviting them to partake of
                    such refreshments as the ship afforded, and making them some handsome presents,
                    the Captain acquainted them with his wants, by shewing them the condition of his
                    ship, and requesting a small portion of ground to land his materials, and to
                    erect his tents. This request was readily granted, at the same time giving the
                    Captain to understand, that the great King was absent, that he had lately been
                    at war with the King of the neighbouring island of Maw-whee, that he was
                    employed in settling the terms of peace, and that in less than ten days he was
                    expected home. That they might, notwithstanding, land whatever they thought fit;
                    and that the ground they had occasion for should be marked out and taboo'd, that
                    is, appropriated to their use, without any of the natives being permitted to
                    encroach upon it. Both Captains very readily embraced the offer, and prepared to
                    accompany their benefactors to the town near which they wished to pitch their
                    tents. Upon their landing, several vacant plats of ground were shewn them, and,
                    when they had made their choice, stakes were ordered to be driven at certain
                    distances, and a line to be carried round, within which the common people were
                    forbidden to enter, under the severest penalties. Matters being thus amicably
                    settled, no time was lost on our part to get every thing on shore. The tents,
                    the armourer's forge, the masts, the sails, the rigging, the water-casks, the
                    bread, the flour, the powder, <pb n="286"/> in short, every article that wanted
                    either to be reviewed or repaired were sent on shore; and not the least
                    interruption was given to the boats employed in the carriage, or insult offered
                    to the persons who conducted them. On the contrary, the Chiefs offered some
                    empty houses, that were conveniently situated near the new dock (if that may be
                    so termed where our artificers were set to work) for the sick to lodge till
                    their recovery. No strangers were ever more hospitably received.</p>
                <p>On the morning after our people landed, six large double canoes were seen
                    entering the harbour at a great rate, having not less than 30 paddles to each
                    canoe, with upwards of 60 Indians on board, most of them naked. Seeing them on
                    their nearer approach making towards the ships, the Captains ordered the guns to
                    be shotted, the marines to be drawn up, and every man to be ready at his post;
                    the Indians assembled so fast, that before noon, the ships were surrounded with
                    more than 100 canoes, in which there were not less than 1000 Indians. They at
                    first traded friendly, having hogs in abundance, and plenty of bread-fruit,
                    plantains, bananoes, and whatever else the island produced; but they had not
                    been there long, before a large stone was thrown in at the cabin-window of the
                    Discovery, by an invisible hand. A watch was instantly set, and in less than
                    half an hour another stone was thrown at the caulkers, as they were at work on a
                    stage on the ship's side. The offender was seen, and in sight of the Chiefs, and
                    the whole multitude, he was seized, brought on board, tied to the shrouds, and
                    punished with fifty lashes. In a few minutes, such was their fright, there was
                    not an Indian to be seen near the ships.—Like unlucky boys, when one is
                    apprehended for some naughty trick, the rest <pb n="287"/> commonly fly the
                    place.—And in fact, these people are in many respects like children, and in
                    none more than in this instance. Before the day closed, they all again returned
                    to trade, and, when night approached, not a male was to be seen; but swarms of
                    females, who came to sleep on board, though much against the will of Capt. Cook,
                    who, upon the first arrival of the ships upon the coast, wished to have
                    prohibited all commerce with the women of the island; but he soon found, that if
                    that commerce was forbidden, all other trade must cease of course, for not a pig
                    could be purchased, unless a girl was permitted to bring it to market.</p>
                <p>There are who have blamed Capt. Cook for his severity to the Indians; but it was
                    not to the Indians alone that he was severe in his discipline. He never
                    suffered any fault in his own people, though ever so trivial, to escape
                    unpunished. If they were charged with insulting an Indian, or injuring him in
                    his property, if the fact was proved, the offender was surely punished in sight
                    of the Indians. By this impartial distribution of justice, the Indians
                    themselves conceived so high an idea of his wisdom, and his power too, that they
                    paid him the same honours as they did their Et-u-a, or Good Spirit.</p>
                <p>The caulkers, who have already been mentioned, when they came round in course to
                    the after-part of the Resolution, found that, besides the seams that wanted
                    closing, there were other more material defects. The rudder's eyes were almost
                    eaten through with rust, and the bolts ready to tumble out. This was an alarming
                    defect; and all other business was suspended till that was repaired. <pb
                        n="288"/> Every thing went on now as smoothly as could be wished. The
                    Chiefs, if they saw any of their own people misbehave, would themselves give
                    information, and bring them to punishment; they were so very obliging, that,
                    seeing us in want of wood to burn, they made an offer of a high fence, that
                    surrounded the Morai, adjoining to the town, for a present supply.</p>
                <p>On the 19th, being the fourth day after our arrival, several very large canoes
                    were seen to come from the S. E. We at first thought they were the friends with
                    whom we had traded on the other side of the island; but on their nearer
                    approach, we found they were all armed and clothed in the military uniform,
                    after their country manner. This gave us cause to suspect some traiterous
                    design, but our fears were in some measure dissipated by the assurances we
                    received from our friends on board, that they were some of the warriors that had
                    accompanied the King in his expedition against the Eree of Maw-wee, and that
                    they were now returning home in triumph; but, notwithstanding this assurance,
                    it was thought prudent to be upon our guard, and the rather as the women who
                    were on board, told us, that their people designed to attack us, and to mattee,
                    that is, to kill us every one.</p>
                <p>Next day, before nine in the morning, more than a thousand Indians surrounded the
                    Discovery, insomuch that pressing their weight chiefly on one side, the ship was
                    in danger of being over-set. The Captain ordered two great guns to be fired, in
                    order to try what effect that would have in dispersing them. In less than three
                    minutes, there were a thousand heads to be seen above water, so many having
                    jumped into the sea, frighted on the sudden report of the guns; neither did a
                    single canoe come near us all the next day. Some of the <pb n="289"/> women
                    however remained on board, who never could be prevailed on to shew themselves
                    upon deck in the day-time; but whether from fear of their own people, or of the
                    great guns, we never could learn. As all trade was now stopt, and nothing
                    brought on board for our subsistence, Capt. Cook went on shore to expostulate
                    with the Chiefs, and by some trifling presents to engage them to trade as
                    before; threatening at the same time to lay their towns waste, if they refused
                    to supply the ships with the provisions they stood in need of. His remonstrances
                    had the desired effect, and next day we purchased not less than 60 large hogs,
                    with great quantities of fruits and vegetables for the ships use.</p>
                <p>In a few days after this, the old King Terreeoboo was seen to enter the harbour,
                    on his return from Maw-wee. In the afternoon he visited the ship in a private
                    manner, attended only by one canoe, in which were his wife and children. He
                    staid on board till near ten at night, when he returned to the village
                    Kowrowa.</p>
                <p> The next day about noon, the King, in a large canoe, attended by two others, set
                    out from the village, and paddled towards the ships, in great state. Their
                    appearance was grand and magnificent. In the first canoe was Terreeoboo, and
                    his Chiefs, dressed in their feathered cloaks and helmets, and armed with long
                    spears and daggers. In the second, came the venerable Kaoo, the Chief of the
                    Priests, and his brethren, with their idols displayed on red cloth. These idols
                    were busts of a gigantic size, made of wicker-work, and curiously covered with
                    small feathers of various colours, wrought in the same manner with their cloaks.
                    Their eyes were made of large pearl oysters, with a black nut fixed in the
                    centre; their mouths were set with a Page 290 double row of the fangs of dogs;
                    and together, with the rest of their features, were strangely distorted. The
                    third canoe was filled with hogs, and various sorts of vegetables. As they went
                    along, the Priests, in the centre canoe, sung their hymns with great solemnity;
                    and after paddling round the ships, instead of going on board as was expected,
                    they made towards the shore, at the beach where our men were stationed. On their
                    approach, the guard was instantly ordered out to receive the King; and Capt.
                    Cook, perceiving he was going on shore, followed him, and arrived nearly at the
                    same time. They were conducted into the tent, where they had scarce been seated,
                    when the King rose up, and, in a very graceful manner, threw over the Captain's
                    shoulders, the cloak he himself wore, put a feathered helmet upon his head, and
                    a curious fan in his hand. He also spread at his feet five or six other cloaks,
                    all exceedingly beautiful, and of great value. His attendants then brought four
                    very large hogs, with sugar-canes, cocoa-nuts, and bread fruit. This part of the
                    ceremony over, they all made a circle round with their images in procession,
                    till they arrived at their Morai, where they placed their deities, and deposited
                    their arms.</p>
                <p>Next day both Captains, accompanied with several of their officers, went to pay
                    the King a visit on shore. They were very respectfully received, and having
                    dined after the Indian manner, the King rose, and clothing Capt. Cook with a
                    mantle, such as is worn by the great Oreno in grand procession, he was
                    conducted to the morai, or place of worship, where a garland of green plantain
                    leaves was put upon his head, and he was seated on a kind of throne, and had the
                    honour of exchanging names with the King, the strongest <pb n="291"/> pledge of
                    friendship these islanders can confer. He was now addressed in a long oration by
                    a priest clothed in a vestment of party-coloured cloth, who concluded the
                    solemnity with a choral hymn, in which he was joined by all the priests present;
                    who had no sooner finished their song than they all fell at his feet, the King
                    acquainting him, that this was now his building, and that he was from henceforth
                    their Orono. From this time an Indian Priest was, by the King's order, placed at
                    the head of his pinnace, at whose approach the Indians in their canoes, as he
                    passed them, prostrated themselves till he was out of sight; and this they did
                    when the Captain was alone: but the Priests had orders from the King, whenever
                    the Captain came ashore in his pinnace, to attend him, and conduct him to his
                    house, which the sailors now called Cook's Altar.</p>
                <p>When all these solemnities were over, we were not a little astonished to find in
                    this King, the same infirm, emaciated, old man, that came on board Capt. Cook
                    when off the island of Ma-wee; and it was soon discovered, that he was then
                    accompanied with the same persons, viz. his two younger sons, one sixteen, the
                    other twelve, with his nephew Maiha-Macha, a man of a most savage
                    countenance.</p>
                <p>[When we first approached the coast of this island of O why hee, we were
                    astonished at the sight of a mountain of a stupendous height, whose head was
                    covered with snow. This was so rare a sight in an island between the tropics,
                    that several of the officers and gentlemen from both ships were desirous of
                    taking a nearer view of it; and for that purpose they requested the King's
                    permission, and a guide to attend them, which was readily granted, <pb n="292"/>
                    and no less than ten Indians contended which should accompany them.]</p>
                <p>On the 26th Mr. Nelson, our botanist, and four other gentlemen set out in the
                    morning on this expedition, which they afterwards found attended with no small
                    fatigue, and not a little danger; for after travelling two days and two nights,
                    and experiencing the greatest fatigue and hardships; no water, no paths to
                    direct their way; no inhabitants for many miles, and the cold excessive as they
                    approached the mountain, which seemed covered with snow, they were glad to get
                    back without any accident. In the course of their journey, they were directed to
                    the cottage of an old hermit, who, they said, had formerly been a great
                    warrior; but who, for several years past, had retired to this sequestered spot.
                    He received them without any kind of emotion, but would accept of nothing that
                    they offered him. He appeared by far the oldest man they had seen on the
                    island.</p>
                <p>On the 29th they returned to the ships, and the only advantage that accrued from
                    their journey, was, a curious assortment of indigenous plants and some natural
                    curiosities, collected by Mr. Nelson. During their absence every thing remained
                    quiet at the tents, and the Indians supplied the ships with such quantities of
                    provisions of all kinds, that orders were given to purchase no more hogs in one
                    day than could be killed, salted, and stowed away the next day. This order was
                    in consequence of a former order, to purchase all that could be procured for
                    sea-stock; by which so many were brought on board, that several of them died
                    before they could be properly disposed of.</p>
                <p>It had been generally thought impracticable to cure the flesh of these animals in
                    the tropical climates; and it is believed, that few trials had ever <pb n="293"
                    /> been made before those of Capt. Cook. In his first voyage in 1774, he first
                    made the attempt, but not very successfully. But it was now become absolutely
                    necessary, either to perfect the discovery, or relinquish the voyage.</p>
                <p>The method we took was always to slaughter them in the afternoon, and as soon as
                    the hair was scalded off, and the entrails removed, the carcass was divided into
                    pieces, from four to eight pounds each, and the bones of the chine and legs
                    taken out, and, in the large sort, the ribs also. Every piece being then
                    carefully wiped and examined, that no bruise might escape, and all the veins
                    cleared out, that no coagulated blood might remain, they were then handed to
                    the salters while the flesh was still warm. After they had been well rubbed with
                    salt, they were then placed in a heap on a stage, raised in the open air,
                    covered with planks, and pressed with the heaviest weights we could lay on them.
                    In this situation they lay till the next evening, when they were again well
                    wiped and examined, and the suspicious parts taken away. They were then put into
                    a tub of strong pickle, where they were always looked over once or twice a day,
                    and if any piece had not taken salt, which was readily discovered by the smell,
                    they were immediately taken out, re-examined, and the sound pieces put to fresh
                    pickle, and the other either used immediately, or thrown away. This, however,
                    seldom happened. After six days, they were taken out, examined for the last
                    time, and being again lightly pressed, they were packed in barrels with a thin
                    layer of salt between them. Some of this pork was brought to England, perfectly
                    sweet and good.</p>
                <p> On the 1st of February, 1779, William Watman, gunner's mate, died. His body in
                    the afternoon was carried on shore in the pinnace, and <pb n="294"/> buried,
                    according to his own desire, in the Morai belonging to the King. The Indians who
                    dug his grave about four feet deep, covered the bottom of it with green leaves;
                    and when the corpse was deposited in the earth, the Chiefs who attended the
                    funeral, put a barbecued hog at the head, and another at the feet, with a
                    quantity of bread-fruit, plantains and bananas. More was going to be added, when
                    Capt. Cook ordered the grave to be covered up, and a post erected to the memory
                    of the deceased, inscribed with his name, the date of the year, day of his
                    death, and the nation to which he belonged. From this circumstance, Capt. Cook
                    gave this port the name of Watman's Harbour. The next day the Indians rolled
                    large stones over his grave, and brought two barbecued hogs, plantains and
                    bananas, cocoa-nuts, and bread-fruit, which they placed over his grave, upon a
                    stage erected for that purpose.</p>
                <p>We were now preparing to depart, when our Captain was presented by the King with
                    twelve large hogs, three boats-load of bread-fruit, potatoes, sugar-cane, and
                    cocoa-nuts; and the same present was made to Capt. Cook.</p>
                <p>This day, Feb. 2, the King came on board, attended with twenty of his Chiefs, and
                    gave the Captains of both ships, with their officers, an invitation to an
                    heiva, in which many of the principal Chiefs were to be performers. Capt.
                    Clerke excused himself from ill health; but Capt. Cook and the other Gentlemen
                    promised to attend.</p>
                <p>The same day the King and his Chiefs dined on board the Resolution, and were
                    entertained with music, the whole band having orders to play all the while they
                    sat at dinner. They were highly delighted with the music, and would not suffer
                    the performers to rest a moment.</p>
                <pb n="295"/>
                <p>About four in the afternoon, the pinnaces from both ships were ordered to be in
                    readiness to take the company ashore, with their pendants and colours
                    displayed, to do honour to a king and people, by whom we had been so hospitably
                    entertained. More than 200 canoes attended us to shore, where a number of
                    Chiefs were ready to receive us, who ail observed a profound silence at our
                    landing, and conducted us to the place appointed for the entertainment. But we
                    were much disappointed by the performers, who were far inferior to those of the
                    Southern islands.</p>
                <p>The only part of the performance that was tolerable, was their singing, with
                    which the heiva or play concluded; the young princesses, the chiefs, and even
                    the king himself joining in the chorus.</p>
                <p>The play being ended, Capt. Cook acquainted the King that, with his permission,
                    he would exhibit some fire-works, that, if they did not frighten, would very
                    much astonish his people. The King very readily gave his consent; and the
                    engineer was ordered to begin his exhibition as soon as it was dark. On the
                    rising of the first sky-rocket, the Indians fled precipitately, and hid
                    themselves in the houses, or wherever they could find any shelter; at first
                    there were some thousand spectators; but in less than ten minutes there were not
                    fifty to be seen, the King and his attendants excepted, whom the Captain and the
                    gentlemen with the greatest difficulty persuaded to stay. When the second rose
                    up in the air, lamentations were heard from every quarter; and when the
                    water-rockets were played off, the King and his Chiefs were hardly to be
                    restrained. Other fire-works it was found dangerous to exhibit, as these had
                    already struck the spectators, the King as well as his people, with a general
                    panic. We therefore took leave of <pb n="296"/> the King and Royal family, and
                    returned on board our respective ships. The King having been made to understand
                    that we should sail the first fair wind, came next morning to visit the Captains
                    of both ships, who were now preparing to sail. This being publicly known, the
                    Indians in general expressed their concern, but particularly the young women,
                    whose lamentations were heard from every quarter.</p>
                <p>In the evening of the 4th of February, all hands were mustered, and none were
                    missing.</p>
                <p>In the morning of the 5th, we cleared the harbour, shaping our course for
                    Maw-wee, as we had been informed by the King, that in that island there was a
                    fine harbour and excellent water. We had not been long under sail, when the
                    King, who had omitted to take his leave of our Captain in the morning, as not
                    suspecting our departure so sudden, came after the ships, accompanied by the
                    young prince, his son, in a sailing canoe, bringing with them ten large hogs, a
                    great number of fowls, and a small turtle (a great rarity) with bread-fruit in
                    abundance. They also brought with them great quantities of cocoa-nuts,
                    plantains, and sugar-canes.</p>
                <p>Besides other persons of condition who acompanied the King, there was an old
                    priest, Kaoa, who had always shewn a particular attachment to Capt. Clerke, and
                    who had not been unrewarded for his civility. It being rather late when they
                    reached the ships, they staid on board but a few hours, and then all departed
                    except the old priest and some girls, who by the King's permission were suffered
                    to remain on board till they should arrive at some of the neighbouring isles. We
                    were now steering with a fine breeze, but just at the close of the evening, to
                    our great mortification, <pb n="297"/> the wind died away, and a great swell
                    succeeding, with a strong current setting right in for the shore, we were in
                    the utmost danger of being driven upon the rocks. In the height of our distress
                    and trouble, the old priest, who had been suffered to sleep in the great cabin,
                    leapt overboard unseen, with a piece of silk, the Captain's property, and swam
                    to shore.</p>
                <p>The next day, seeing a large canoe between us and the shore, we hove-to for her
                    coming up, and to our great surprize perceived the old King, accompanied by
                    several of his Chiefs, having in their vessel the priest who had stolen the
                    silk, whom the King delivered to the Captain, at the same time requesting that
                    his fault might be forgiven. The King being told that his request was granted,
                    unbound him, and set him at liberty; telling the Captain that, seeing him with
                    the silk, he judged it was none of his own, and therefore ordered him to be
                    apprehended; and had taken this method of exposing him for injuring his friend.
                    This singular instance of Indian generosity and justice, ought not to be
                    forgotten. It appears, however, that this old priest, who had changed names, and
                    was proud of being called Bretanne, had slipt away from Mr. Bligh, master of the
                    Resolution, to whom he had pretended to discover a much more commodious
                    harbour, than that of Kakooa, which they had just left. As soon as they had
                    delivered the silk, which the Captain would have had the King to accept, they
                    departed, and had scarce reached the shore, when a heavy gale came on, with
                    thunder, lightning, and hard rain. We wore ship, and continued working off the
                    land all night, and soon lost sight of the Resolution, who, as well as the
                    Discovery, continued bea•ing about the island seven days successively, in <pb
                        n="298"/> dread every moment of being wrecked upon the coast. On the fourth
                    day, after we had lost sight of the Resolution, the storm being a little abated,
                    we observed her under a high part of the island, lying with her
                    fore-top-gallant-mast down, her fore-top-sail-yard upon the cap, and the sail
                    furled, which gave us reason to suppose that some accident had befallen her;
                    and as we expected, so we found it. We stood down for her with a heavy gale; but
                    it was not till next day that we could come to speak with her. Capt. Cook
                    himself being upon deck when we came up, informed us that he had sprung his
                    fore-mast in two different places; that the ship was leaky, and that it was with
                    the greatest difficulty they kept her above water. He further said, that on the
                    7th in the morning they discovered the leak; that at that time they made thirty
                    inches of water in three hours; and that ever since all hands had been
                    constantly employed night and day in baling and pumping; we likewise understood,
                    that they had split their main-top-sail, and that they were now bound to our
                    late harbour to repair their damage. We pursued the same course; but it was not
                    till the 11th, when we opened on the bay in which lay our port. We were very
                    soon surrounded with our old friends, who brought us hogs, bread-fruit,
                    plantains, bananoes, and cocoa-nuts, which they threw on board, without waiting
                    for any recompense. We were likewise visited by the old King, the Prince, and
                    many of the Chiefs, who came to welcome us, and who were seemingly glad of our
                    return. About ten in the morning, both ships moored near their old birth, and
                    presently all hands were set to work to strip the mast, and to carry it on
                    shore to be repaired.</p>
                <pb n="299"/>
                <p>The next day the King came again on board, and mutual presents and mutual
                    civilities were continued as usual: but about five in the afternoon, there came
                    along-side a large canoe, with about 60 of their fighting men, all armed, with
                    little or no provisions on board, and who seemed to have no good design. Our
                    Captain observing their motions, ordered the guns to be shotted, and every man
                    to his post. About six, they departed, without offering the least insult; but
                    soon after we saw, upon a high hill, a large body assembled, who were observed
                    to be gathering stones, and laying them in heaps. At dark they were seen to
                    disperse; but great lights and fires were kept burning all night.</p>
                <p>In the morning of the 13th, they again assembled, and began rolling the stones
                    from the brink of the hill, in order, as we supposed, to divert our attention,
                    but which rather served to awaken our fears. Our Captains looking upon this as
                    an insult, ordered the guns to be levelled, and fired among them, and in ten
                    minutes there was not an Indian to be seen near the place.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon, the King came on board the Resolution, and complained to Capt.
                    Cook of our killing two of his people, intimating at the same time, that they
                    had not the least intention of hurting us. He continued on board some hours,
                    amusing himself with seeing the armourers at work; and when he departed,
                    requested that they might be permitted to make him a Pahoo-a, (an instrument
                    they use in battle when they come to close quarters) which was readily
                    granted.</p>
                <p>From this time forward the natives became very tumultuous and unruly, and stole
                    every thing they could lay their hands on, with any tolerable chance of
                    escaping. They were fired upon, but <pb n="300"/> that only enraged them. One
                    who had just stolen the armourer's tongs and an iron chisel, with both which he
                    was making to shore, was intercepted by Capt. Cook himself, who, with a few
                    marines, endeavoured to seize him as he was landing; but the Indians seeing his
                    design, came rushing in a body to the water-side, among whom the fellow found
                    means to secrete himself; and the multitude, instead of delivering him up,
                    attacked the boats that were in pursuit of him, seized their oars, broke them,
                    and forced our whole party to retreat.</p>
                <p>Capt. Cook having only a few marines with him, part of those who were placed as a
                    guard to the carpenters employed upon the mast, did not think proper to renew
                    the attack; but returned to the tents, ordering a strict watch to be kept during
                    the night, and his whole force to be kept under arms till the matter should be
                    accommodated. For this purpose, Mr. Edgar, our master, was sent with a message
                    to the young prince, who from the beginning had behaved friendly, to acquaint
                    him with the cause of the fray, and to demand the delinquent to be delivered
                    up. The prince, instead of listening to his remonstrances, assumed another
                    countenance, and Mr. Edgar was very roughly handled, and glad to make his escape
                    with a sound beating.</p>
                <p>The temper of the Indians was now totally changed, and they became every day more
                    and more troublesome.</p>
                <p>On the 14th, a vast multitude of them were seen together, making great
                    lamentation, and moving slowly along to the beating of a drum, that scarce gave
                    a stroke in a minute. From this circumstance, it was supposed they were burying
                    the dead, who had been killed the day before.<pb n="301"/> No violence, however,
                    was either done or attempted this day, though the girls that were on board gave
                    us to understand, that their countrymen only waited a favourable opportunity to
                    attack the ships.</p>
                <p>On the morning of the 15th, our great cutter, which was moored to the buoy, was
                    missing from her moorings, and, upon examination, the boat's painter was found
                    cut two fathoms from the buoy, and the remainder of the rope gone with the
                    boat.</p>
                <p>This gave cause to suspect that some villainy was concerting; and, in order to
                    prevent the ill-consequences that might follow, both Captains met on board the
                    Resolution, to consult what was best to be done on this critical occasion. The
                    officers from both ships were present at this council, where it was resolved to
                    seize the King, and to confine him on board till the boat should be
                    returned.</p>
                <p>With this view, early on the morning of the 16th, Capt. Cook, with Mr. Phillips,
                    Lieutenant of Marines, and nine of his men, went on shore, under cover of the
                    guns of both ships, to one side of the bay where the King resided; and Mr. King,
                    second Lieutenant of the Resolution, who had always been stationed with a guard
                    to protect the working party and the waterers on shore, went, as usual, to the
                    other side. The Indians, observing our motions, and seeing the ships warping
                    towards the towns, of which there were two, one on each side the bay, they
                    concluded that our design was to seize their marine. In consequence of which,
                    most of their large war canoes took the alarm, and were making off, when our
                    guns, loaded with grape and canister shot, drove them back; and the Captain and
                    his guard landed without opposition. We observed, however, that their warriors
                    were clothed in their military dress, <pb n="302"/> though without arms, and
                    that they were gathering together in a body from every direction, their Chiefs
                    assuming a very different countenance to what they usually wore upon all former
                    occasions. However, Capt. Cook, attended by the Lieutenant of Marines, a
                    Serjeant, and nine privates, regardless of appearances, proceeded directly to
                    the King's residence, where they found him seated on the ground, with about
                    twelve of his Chiefs round him, who all prostrated themselves on seeing the
                    Orono enter. The Captain addressed the King in the mildest terms, assuring him
                    that no violence was intended against his person or any of his people, except
                    against those who had been guilty of a most unprecedented act of robbery, by
                    cutting from her moorings one of the ship's boats, without which they could
                    neither conveniently water the ships, nor carry on the necessary communication
                    with the shore; calling upon the King, at the same time, to give orders for the
                    boat to be immediately restored, and inviting him, in the most friendly manner,
                    to accompany him on board, till his orders should be carried into execution. The
                    King protested his total ignorance of the theft; said, he was very ready to
                    assist in discovering the thief, and should be glad to see him punished; and
                    shewed no unwillingness himself to trust his person with the Orono, though he
                    had lately exercised very unusual severities against his people. He was told
                    that the tumultuous appearance of his people, and their repeated robberies,
                    made some uncommon severities necessary; but that not the least hurt should be
                    done to the meanest inhabitant of his island by any person belonging to the
                    ships, without exemplary punishment; and all that was necessary for the
                    continuance of peace was, to pledge himself for the <pb n="303"/> honesty of
                    his people. With that view, and that view only, the Captain said he came to
                    request the King to place confidence in him, and to make his ship his residence,
                    as the most effectual means of putting a stop to the robberies that were now
                    daily and hourly committed and committing, by his people, both at the tents and
                    on board the ships, and were so daring as to become insufferable. The King, upon
                    this remonstrance, was preparing to comply, and his two sons were actually on
                    board the pinnace to accompany the Orono, when a woman, mother to the boys, and
                    a great favourite of the King's, came after them, and, with many tears and
                    entreaties, besought them to come on shore and not to go on board the ships. The
                    Chiefs, at the same time, began to take the alarm; but the good old King, not
                    yet suspecting, or pretending not to suspect, any treachery, had made himself
                    ready to accompany the Captain, and was actually on his way; but by this time
                    the women and children were sent away, and the men put on their war mats, and
                    armed themselves, and so great a body of Indians were got together, and had
                    lined the shore, that it was impossible they could break through the multitude,
                    who now began to behave outrageously, and to insult the guard. Capt. Cook,
                    observing their behaviour, gave orders to the officer of marines to make way,
                    and if any one opposed, to fire upon and instantly dispatch him. This order the
                    Lieutenant endeavoured to carry into execution, and a lane was made for the King
                    and his Chiefs to get to the boats; but they had scarce reached the water-side,
                    when the word was given, that the Orono (for so they called Capt. Cook) was
                    about to carry off their King to kill him. In an instant a number of their
                    fighting men broke <pb n="304"/> from the crowd, and with clubs and stones
                    rushed in upon the guard, four of whom were presently dispatched. A ruffian
                    making a stroke at Capt. Cook, was shot dead by the Captain himself, who, having
                    a double-barreled gun, was aiming at another, when a savage came behind him, and
                    striking him on the head with his club, felled him to the ground; and then
                    thrust his pahooa through his body with such force, that, entering between his
                    shoulders, the point of it came out at his breast. The quarrel now became
                    general. The guns from the ships began to pour in their fire upon the crowd, and
                    the musquetry from the boars; but such was their intrepidity, that, contrary to
                    all expectation, they stood their ground, and carried off in triumph the bodies
                    of the dead.</p>
                <p>Besides Capt. Cook, whose death was universally deplored, Corporal Thomas, and
                    three privates, Hinkes, Allen, and Fadget, fell victims to their fury; and
                    three more of the marines were desperately wounded. Lieut. Phillips, who had
                    received a wound between the shoulders with a pahooa, shot the man dead who had
                    wounded him, just as he was going to repeat his blow: it seemed as if it was
                    against our Commodore that their vengeance was chiefly directed, by whose order
                    they supposed their king was to be forced on board, and punished at his
                    discretion. Seeing him fall, they set up a great shout, and his body was
                    instantly surrounded by the enemy, who snatching the dagger out of each other's
                    hands, they shewed a savage eagerness to have a share in his destruction.</p>
                <p>Thus fell the greatest navigator that this or any other nation could boast; the
                    account of whose death was transmitted to England by Professor Page
                    [unnumbered] [illustration] [depiction of the murder of Captain Cook at Hawaii]
                    Representation of the Murder of Capt Cook at O'Why-ee <pb n="305"/> Pallas, from
                    Petersburg, long before the arrival of our journalist; and with such
                    circumstances of agreement in the principal facts, as sufficiently prove the
                    authenticity of both.</p>
                <p>The Professor says, "The inhabitants shewed Capt. Cook (during his first stay) a
                    respect that bordered on adoration; but on his second landing they grew more
                    thievish than before; and at last, the cutter belonging to the Discovery was cut
                    loose and carried away. The day after this happened the Captain, with his
                    Lieutenant, and nine marines, landed. He went up to the residence of the chief
                    Terreboo. He was received with respect; but he found a great crowd assembled
                    with the chief. Some of them grew insolent as he made his complaints; one of
                    them in particular indulged his grimaces in so provoking a manner, that the
                    Captain discharged at him the shot of his fowling-piece. On which a general
                    commotion ensued. The Lieutenant fired, and killed one dead upon the spot; but
                    instead of dispersing, they now made a general attack, and though the marines
                    fired one round with great effect, the crowd was not intimidated, but rushed on
                    with such rapidity, that there was no time to load again. In the first onset
                    Capt. Cook and four of his people were unhappily killed upon the spot; and it
                    was with great difficulty that the Lieutenant and the remaining marines could
                    make their retreat, most of them wounded; and it would have been almost
                    impossible for them to have escaped, had it not been for the fire from the
                    pinnace and long-boat, that lay at some distance from the beach. Capt. Clerke
                    saw no possibility of revenging the loss of his gallant countryman but with
                    great slaughter, he therefore <pb n="306"/> kept upon the defensive." —To return
                    to our Journalist.</p>
                <p>The dead being past recovery, the distressed situation of the living was now to
                    be regarded. The Resolution was without her mast, and lay in a manner at the
                    mercy of the savages, who it was every moment expected, would have cut away her
                    moorings and drifted her on shore. It was therefore the first care of Capt.
                    Clerke, who succeeded to the command, to order the mast to be floated away, and
                    to get the tents and all our other baggage on board. For this purpose no time
                    was to be lost. While many of the natives lay dead upon the beach, it was
                    judged the properest time to take advantage of that interval of inactivity,
                    which always succeeds any considerable exertion of Indian ferocity. Lieutenant
                    King, who, as has been observed before, commanded the working-party on the
                    other side the bay, and who had cultivated a friendship with the priests, whose
                    dwellings were contiguous to the Morai, was all this while ignorant of what was
                    going forward; but could not help being under inexpressible anxiety at seeing
                    the extraordinary agitation by land, and hearing the firing from the ships at
                    sea, and the boats near the shore; but at the same time had assured the priests,
                    who were equally alarmed, that whatever might be the matter, they should be
                    safe; was not a little startled, when just at that critical moment, two great
                    shot from the Discovery cut a tree in the middle, under which some of them were
                    sitting, and split a piece from a rock in a direct line to their dwellings: for
                    Capt. Clerke being under no less concern for Lieut. King and those under his
                    command, and having no clue, but appearances to go by, had caused <pb n="307"/>
                    the fire of the great guns to be directed to that quarter, as soon as the
                    natives were dispersed from the other. Our whole force was therefore collected,
                    and, having landed under cover of our guns, we marched rapidly up the hill, with
                    bayonets fixed, and took possession of the Morai, which stood on elevated
                    ground, and gave us an advantage over the savages, who could not approach us
                    from the shore, neither could they attack us from the towns, without being
                    exposed to our fire from the ships. They made several unsuccessful attempts to
                    dislodge us, but were repulsed with loss. After sustaining an unequal conflict
                    for three hours, in which several of them were killed, without being able to
                    make any impression on our small body, and without our losing a man, though
                    several were much hurt by the stones from their slings, they at length
                    dispersed, and left us masters of our tents and of all our other property.</p>
                <p>Our next care was to recover the bodies of our dead. A strong party under Lieut.
                    King, were sent out in the pinnaces and boats, with a white flag, in token of
                    peace, to endeavour to procure them. They were met by Koah, a Chief, (with whom
                    Mr. King was well acquainted) and of note among the savages, at the head of a
                    vast multitude, without at first answering our signal; but Mr. King, commanding
                    the armed boats to stop, and going himself in a small boat alone, with a white
                    flag in his hand, had the satisfaction to be instantly understood; the men
                    threw off their war-mats; the women returned to the beach, and Koah shewed equal
                    confidence, by swimming off with a flag in his hand, and on entering the boat
                    where Mr. King sat, with as much unconcern as if nothing had happened: being
                    told <pb n="308"/> that they were come to demand the body of Capt. Cook, or to
                    declare war, if it was not instantly restored, he assured the Lieutenant, that
                    he would go himself and procure it, begged a piece of iron of him, and joyfully
                    swam on shore, calling out to his countrymen, that now we were all friends
                    again; but notwithstanding this Chief's dissembled friendship, our men in the
                    boats, who had entered into parley with the natives, were informed, that the
                    warriors were then on the back of the hill, cutting up and dividing the bodies
                    of the slain. While we remained in our boats, several other Chiefs came to the
                    water-side; and one in particular, with Capt. Cook's hanger, which he drew in a
                    vaunting manner, and brandished it over his head; others shewed themselves with
                    the spoils taken from the dead; one having a jacket, another a shirt, a third a
                    pair of trowsers, and so on; insulting us, as it were, with the trophies of
                    their victory.</p>
                <p>At this time it was thought prudent to stifle our resentment, and to reserve our
                    vengeance till a more favourable opportunity. We were now in want of water; our
                    sails and rigging in a shattered condition; our cordage bad, and our repairs not
                    near finished; all therefore we had to do, was to remain upon the defensive
                    till we were better provided.</p>
                <p>At the close of the evening, as soon as it was dark, a canoe was heard paddling
                    towards the Resolution, in which were two men. As it approached, both sentinels
                    fired, but without hurting either of the men, though the balls went through the
                    bottom of the canoe. Notwithstanding this, the canoe came close under the
                    ship's stern; and one of the men calling out Tinne, Tinne, (the name Mr. King
                    was known by) whom the Priests had always <pb n="309"/> supposed to be the
                    Orono's son, and, therefore, the Earee of the ship, this excited every one's
                    curiosity, and orders were given to admit them on board; they were priests, and
                    produced a piece of flesh, carefully wrapped up in a cloth, which they solemnly
                    assured us was part of the thigh of our late Commander; that he saw it cut from
                    the bone, but believed that all the flesh of the body was burnt; that the head
                    and all the bones, except what belonged to the trunk, were in the possession
                    of Terreoboo, and the other Chiefs; that what we saw, had been brought to Kaoa,
                    the High Priest, to be made use of in some religious ceremony; and that he had
                    sent it as a proof of the sincerity of his innocence and his friendship. Being
                    asked, if any part of the flesh had been eaten, they expressed the utmost horror
                    at the idea. They afterwards asked, with some apparent apprehension, when the
                    Orono would come again, and what he would do to them on his return? The same
                    question had been asked by others, which shews, the opinion they entertain of
                    the spirit's power after it is separated from the body. They then desired to be
                    set at liberty, which was granted. One of the men was the Priest who had
                    attended Capt. Cook, and who was ready on all occasions, to fall down and
                    worship him. He lamented his loss with abundance of tears, and earnestly
                    besought us to keep their coming a secret, for if it should be known, it would
                    prove fatal to their whole fraternity. They farther informed us, that 17 of
                    their countrymen were killed in the first action at Kowrowa, of whom five were
                    Chiefs; and that Kaneena and his brother, our particular friends, were among the
                    number; eight, they said, were killed at the observatory, of whom three were of
                    the first rank. As this was the fact, <pb n="310"/> the story that was given out
                    to conceal it, may be worth relating.</p>
                <p>On the 19th, says our journalist, the father and mother of two girls, who had
                    concealed themselves on board the ship, came in the dead of the night, in their
                    canoe, loaded with cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit, which they had been gathering in
                    the day for their own subsistence, as a supply for their children, lest, from
                    what had happened, they should have been suffered to die for want; acquainting
                    us at the same time with a treacherous design of their countrymen to cut our
                    cables, and drift the ships ashore. They were taken on board, and detained
                    prisoners till morning, when not an Indian was to be seen near the harbour, but
                    such as were old and feeble, and knew not how to make their escape. The
                    informers were tenderly treated, had presents made them, and were afterwards
                    dismissed, at their own desire, upon a neighbouring island, with every token of
                    kindness.—The truth is, the Priests had desired the guard-boat to attend them,
                    lest they should have been fired at, and interrupted by the guard-boats of the
                    other ship, by which they might have been discovered, and perhaps put to
                    death.</p>
                <p>Among other incidents of the present day, Feb. 16, there was one which could not
                    be understood. Two boys were seen swimming towards the ships, singing, as they
                    approached the ships, a mournful and plaintive song. They had each a long spear
                    in his hand, which, on boarding the Discovery, they delivered to the Officer on
                    the deck, and then departed. Who sent them, or for what purpose, we never could
                    learn.</p>
                <p>On the 17th, the different promotions took place, and according to their
                    succession, the Officers changed ships; Capt. Clerke went on board Page 311 the
                    Resolution, and Mr. Gore, first Lieutenant of the Resolution, took the command
                    of the Discovery.</p>
                <p>On the 18th both ships were again warped near the shore, and a spring put upon
                    their cables, in order to cover the boats which were sent to compleat our
                    complement of water. On this motion crowds of inhabitants were seen to assemble,
                    with a large black flag displayed, which we interpreted as a signal for war; but
                    we afterwards found that it was part of their ceremony in burying their dead.
                    Under this mistake a few guns were fired from the ships to disperse them, by
                    which the King's nephew, Maiha Maiha, was wounded, and a poor woman lost her
                    arm. This made a strong impression on the whole body of Indians, and we were
                    left in quiet both this and the next day, to pursue our repairs and compleat our
                    hold.</p>
                <p>On the 19th they began again to be troublesome. In the morning, while the boats
                    were loading, at the well, the stones came about the watermen like hail, some of
                    them of more than a pound weight; one in particular was seen coming; but who
                    threw it, no one could tell. This being attended to, a native was observed to
                    creep out of a cavern, who, as soon as he had discharged his stone, retired back
                    to his place of shelter. Him we marked, and returned to our ships; and it being
                    now apparent that nothing was to be gained by fair means, orders were given to
                    strike terror among them, by pursuing them with fire and sword. About two in the
                    afternoon, all who were able to bear arms, as well sailors and artificers as
                    marines, were mustered, and preparations made to sustain them, while with
                    lighted torches they rowed on shore, and set fire to the S. E. town, pursuing
                    the frighted inhabitants while their <pb n="312"/> houses were in flames, with
                    unrelenting fury. Many were put to death, and all driven to seek shelter where
                    they could, scarce a house having escaped the general conflagration. In this
                    vindictive enterprize, the cavern or hole of the crafty Indian, whose insolence
                    had been one principal cause of the desolation that followed, was not
                    forgotten. His cavern had been marked, as has already been observed, and on
                    seeing our sailors approach it, such was his inveteracy, that he heaved a huge
                    stone at the assailants, one of whom he dangerously wounded, but was instantly
                    dispatched by the discharge of three muskets, and a bayonet run through his
                    body. Our vengeance being now fully executed, we returned to the ships, loaded
                    with the spoils of the towns, consisting of bows and arrows, clubs, and arms of
                    all kinds, which they use in battle; and having the heads of two of their
                    fighting men, of which the courageous native was one, stuck at the bows of the
                    pinnaces, as a terror to the enemy from ever daring again to molest us.</p>
                <p>About four in the afternoon of the 20th, ten girls came down to the well, where
                    the waterers were busy, with quantities of fruit, as much as they could carry,
                    for which they would take nothing in return, only praying to be taken on board.
                    This was denied them, as peremptory orders had been given by Capt. Clerke,
                    forbidding the admission of any more of their women.</p>
                <p>This day, in the morning, a Chief was seen coming down the hill, followed by a
                    number of boys, with a white flag displayed, and carrying boughs and green
                    branches in their hands. They came singing to the water side; but that did not
                    prevent their receiving the fire of a party that was placed as a guard. On
                    seeing his ensign answered <pb n="313"/> by a white flag at each
                    mizen-top-mast-head, he, accompanied with three other Chiefs, came on board,
                    having some cocoa-nuts, plantains, and bread-fruit, as presents to the
                    Commander, for which they would accept of nothing in return. This Chief, whose
                    name was Eappo, came to make submission; and, as a token of his sincerity,
                    promised to collect the bones of our deceased warrior, as he called him, and to
                    bring them, and lay them at our feet. This was the token of the most perfect
                    submission that a native warrior could make to his conqueror; and this was
                    accepted on the part of our Commander. In this manner, and on these conditions,
                    peace was to be restored.</p>
                <p>At nine in the morning of the next day, the same old Chief returned, attended by
                    a more numerous suit than before, having several large hogs added to his
                    peace-offerings; and with him, likewise, he brought the bones of Capt. Cook, his
                    back-bone, and the bones of his feet only excepted, which he promised to
                    produce the next visit he made. On examination, the head appeared to have been
                    scalped; the face was entirely gone; the hands had the flesh on, but scored and
                    salted; and, as he assured the Captain, most of the flesh besides was burnt. Our
                    Commander made signs to return the cutter, but was told it was broke up and
                    burnt for the iron. The arms belonging to the marines, who were killed, were
                    next demanded; but these, it was said, were carried up the country by common
                    people, and were irrecoverable. Some presents were made to this friendly Chief,
                    who departed well satisfied. We were now preparing to depart, when provisions of
                    all sorts came pouring in upon us faster than we could consume them. The Chief
                    kept his promise, and <pb n="314"/> On the 23d, Eappo and the King's son, came
                    on board, and brought the bones of the Captain that were missing: these were all
                    placed in due form, in a case made for the purpose, and under a triple discharge
                    from the ships, buried in the bay. The terror of the natives on this occasion
                    was increased, by a four pound ball being loaded by mistake, which fortunately
                    did no other mischief than that of exciting the jealousy of the natives, that
                    our professions of peace were not sincere; which possibly might be the case
                    with him who loaded the gun, as the sailors in general could hardly be
                    restrained from violence, whenever a native came within their power. Nothing
                    more remained now to be done.</p>
                <p>This day we had the satisfaction of getting the foremast of the Resolution shipt,
                    which was a work of great labour, and some difficulty, as the ropes were now
                    become rotten, and unable to sustain the purchase; however, that being at length
                    accomplished, and the repairs compleated, so far at least as our circumstances
                    would allow, we bent our sails in the morning; and were visited by many of our
                    former friends, among whom was the King's youngest son, a boy of about fourteen
                    years of age, of whom Capt. Cook was remarkably fond; and the boy, in return,
                    was no less attached to the Captain. He came to express his sorrow for the
                    accident that had happened, which he did by a plentiful flow of tears. He gave
                    us to understand, that his two brothers were killed, and that his father was
                    retired to an inaccessible place. Capt. Clerke made him some presents that were
                    pleasing to him, and he departed very much comforted.</p>
                <p>About 7 in the evening, a breeze springing up in our favour, we unmoored, and
                    soon left <pb n="315"/> Karakakooa Bay, for that was the name of the bay in
                    which we had been moored, shaping our course to the N. W. Nothing remarkable
                    till The 28th, when we opened upon a fine bay, in one of the Leeward Islands,
                    called by the inhabitants O-aa-ah, where the ships came to an anchor, and where
                    both Captains landed: they found a fine running river, but brackish towards the
                    sea; they therefore made a very short stay. Several of the inhabitants came on
                    board, who were so immoderately fond of iron, that they endeavoured to wrench
                    the very ring-bolts from the hatches. Here we put ashore the family that
                    accompanied us from O-why-e, and here we purchased a few small swine; some
                    bread-fruit and plantains, and a quantity of a root called Ta-ee, not unlike
                    fern-root, but of an enormous size, some weighing from 60 to 70 pounds. It is a
                    powerful anti-scorbutic, of the saccharine kind. Pounded, we made an excellent
                    liquor from it, very pleasant, and exceedingly wholesome. We had quantities of
                    it when we reached Kamshatska, and as good as when first purchased. Having found
                    nothing else to engage our attention in this island, we set sail in the evening;
                    and Next day, March 1, about noon, we moored in our old birth, which,
                    notwithstanding, had a most beautiful appearance from the sea, being well
                    cultivated, and full of villages. We made sail in the evening for Atooi, where
                    we had anchored the preceding summer. We learned that the name of the island we
                    had just left, was Woahoo, lat. 21.50. N. long. 202.15. E. Here we were
                    received with seeming coolness. Hogs, and the produce of the island, were
                    brought us indeed in abundance; but when our casks were landed, in order to
                    exchange our water (that of O-why-he <pb n="316"/> being both bitter and
                    brackish, and the water here excellent) the coopers were no sooner set to work,
                    than one native snatched up an adze, another a bucket, a third a bag of nails,
                    and so on; and this among a crowd of people of more than four or five hundred in
                    number. To put a stop to these depredations, orders were given to fire over
                    their heads; but this not having the desired effect, a gun from the ships threw
                    them all into confusion. Two were seen to drop; and by the shrieks and cries of
                    the women, more were supposed to have been killed or wounded. For a while the
                    multitude retreated; but being rallied by some of their Chiefs, who doubtless
                    had heard that we were not invulnerable, they returned in greater numbers than
                    before, when it was thought prudent to lay aside watering, and to provide for
                    our own safety. All hands were now ordered to their posts, and an engagement
                    commenced in earnest, when the Indians instantly gave way, after a few being
                    killed and wounded by our fire; and they never again offered the least violence
                    during our stay. A perfect agreement took place, and presents were mutually
                    exchanged on both sides.</p>
                <p>The reason assigned for our cold reception at first, was, because we had
                    introduced among their women a bad disorder, when at that harbour before, of
                    which many of their people had died.—But now, peace being established, all the
                    bad water was started from both ships, and a plentiful stock of good water
                    taken on board, to serve us during our long run to Kamshatska, for which we were
                    preparing. Here one of the Chiefs, named Noo-oh-a, expressed a desire to
                    accompany us in our voyage, when, being told that we were never more to return
                    to that island, he lamented the opportunity <pb n="317"/> he had lost when we
                    were here before; and pointing to the sun, seemed to suppose that we should
                    visit that luminary in our course, and that the thunder and lightning of our
                    guns, and that which came from above, were both derived from the same
                    source.</p>
                <p>Before our departure, an Indian brought on board our ship, a piece of iron, to be
                    fashioned into a podooa, which, upon examination, appeared to be the bolt of
                    some large piece of ship timbers, larger than any that our ships could produce.
                    This excited the curiosity of the officers on board; but no farther discovery
                    could be made, but that it had been taken from a part of a large ship that had
                    been drifted on the coast since our leaving the island in 1778. It was of a
                    paler colour than our iron; but of what nation, we were unable to discover.</p>
                <p>From this harbour we sailed on the 9th, and visited the opposite side of the
                    island, where we had likewise passed a part of the former winter. Here we were
                    received with much kindness and hospitality; and here we purchased yams and
                    potatoes for our summer's consumption, which the companies of both ships were
                    glad to accept in exchange for their allowance of bread, that part of their food
                    being both scanty and bad.</p>
                <p>Besides the natural productions of the country, we purchased in these islands
                    many tons of salt, much of their cordage and cloth, and a great variety of
                    artificial curiosities, such as their weapons of war, their instruments for
                    fishing; their cloaks and coverlets; their caps, masks, nets, instruments of
                    music; their needles, thread, working tools, bracelets, ear-jewels, and, in
                    short, almost every thing that was new to us, or which was peculiar to them;
                    among which were some household <pb n="318"/> utensils, and prints for
                    impressing their cloth. The island we are now preparing to leave is named
                    Oneeheow, and lies in lat. 21.49. N. and in long. E. from London, 193
                    nearly.</p>
                <p>On the 15th, we made sail; and soon after were informed that Capt. Clerke was
                    taken ill. We at first stood to the Westward, veering a little to the South, in
                    search of a small island, named Modoo Pappapa, which, we were told, abounded in
                    turtle. We continued this course till The 30th, when we were in lat. 20.19. N.
                    long. 180.40. per watch. We now altered our course, and steered N. W.</p>
                <p>April 1, we continued steering N. W. ½ W. lat. 21.46. N. long. 180.2.</p>
                <p>On the 3d, we crossed the Northern Tropic, long. 177.39. E. steering N. W. by N.
                    in a direct course for Kamshatska. On the 3d day, after leaving the island of
                    Oneeheow, it began to blow a hard gale, which continued, with very little
                    intermission, to the present day, when our ship became very leaky, and we were
                    informed that the Resolution was much worse than the Discovery.</p>
                <p>On the 9th, for the first time, since our leaving Oneeheow, or Nehu, as the
                    sailors called it, we had an observation, and found ourselves in lat. 32.16.
                    long. 160.40. E.</p>
                <p>On the 10th, we observed a tropic bird hovering about the ship, and by her
                    motions we expected her to light, being far to the Northward of her proper
                    climate; however she left us, and made for the Resolution. In the evening it
                    began to blow, with heavy rain, and continued an unremitting gale till The
                    13th, when we were in lat. 39.50. very cold and foggy. As we now began to
                    approach the higher Northern latitudes, the flannel jackets <pb n="319"/> that
                    had been stored up while we were among the tropical islands, were again brought
                    into use, and were of infinite service to the poor men. We now altered our
                    course to the Eastward, having great signs of land on our larboard beam.</p>
                <p>On the 15th, being in lat. 41.59. the signs of land increased. The weather being
                    fine and clear, we seized this opportunity to search for the leak, and, knowing
                    it to be forwards, we moved the sails from the fore sail-room, and found them
                    wringing wet; but the leak was out of our reach; however, when the weather was
                    fine, it gave us very little trouble.</p>
                <p>On the 16th, the Resolution's boat came on board, and Capt. Gore and our first
                    Lieutenant went to visit Capt. Clerke, who still continued very ill. On their
                    return, they brought a dismal account of the condition of the Resolution; she
                    became leaky on the 7th, when it blew a tempest. On the carpenters going down to
                    the cockpit for lights, they were alarmed by finding themselves over their shoes
                    in water, and, upon further examination, the casks in the fish-room and
                    spirit-room were driving one against another, by which two casks of French
                    brandy were staved. They then searched forwards, where they found the coal-hole
                    six feet deep in water, and the ship's whole complement of paint destroyed;
                    several casks of shells and curiosities staved, the light-room deck blown up,
                    and the bulk-head between the gunner's store-room and the coal-hole, burst open.
                    In this alarming situation, they continued during the whole time that this
                    stormy weather lasted, pumping night and day; and every officer in the ship (the
                    Captain, who was ill, only excepted) took his turn with the common men, who
                    were sickening apace with fatigue; nor were <pb n="320"/> they then relieved
                    from hard duty, when our gentlemen left the ship; which was the reason we could
                    make no stay to examine the extent of De Gama's or Company's Land, which,
                    however, we discovered, by our run, not to extend farther to the Eastward than
                    it is marked in our ordinary maps. The misfortune of the Resolution's people did
                    not end with the damages above recited; much of their bread was spoiled, and
                    they were forced to take from us a ton of yams to supply its place.</p>
                <p>On the 18th, we lost sight of the Resolution; but by every appearance were at no
                    great distance from land. Large pieces of timber drifted by us, and land birds
                    innumerable were seen to the Westward. We were now in lat. 46.10. and our long.
                    160.25. running at the rate of seven or eight knots an hour.</p>
                <p>On the 19th, we came in sight of the Resolution: and though it blew hard, they
                    threw out the signal for us to make sail, from whence we concluded that the
                    leak still distressed them. At noon we were in lat. 48.38. and long. 159.10.</p>
                <p>On the 20th, we had a deep snow, attended with frost, by which our men were
                    exposed to incredible hardships. It fell so heavy upon the decks and rigging,
                    that it was next to impossible to keep them clear, or, not being clear, to make
                    the ropes traverse. Fortunately it ceased freezing in the night.</p>
                <p>On the 21st, we were in lat. 49.48. when we began to get every thing in readiness
                    for coming to anchor.</p>
                <p>On the 22d, we were in the latitude of London; the water of a milky colour, but
                    no soundings at eighty-five fathom. In the evening, the Resolution made the
                    signal to tack ship, and we <pb n="321"/> never afterwards saw her till our
                    arrival at our destined harbour.</p>
                <p>On the 23d, we came in sight of land, very barren, very rugged, and covered with
                    snow; from whence we were distant not above a league, with our starboard tacks
                    on board, the water near the shore black with wild fowl, and a sheet of ice
                    skirting the land, covered with sea-lions, seals, and other amphibious animals.
                    At half past ten, P. M. we were put about, finding by our logbook and watch,
                    that we were fifty miles to leeward of our port.</p>
                <p>On the 25th, we were out of sight of land, with a heavy gale, a fall of snow,
                    piercing cold, and twenty of our hands frost-nipped.</p>
                <p>The 26th, it blew hard from the N. E. We kept working to windward, which doubled
                    our labour; and our concern for our Commodore increased so much the more, as we
                    judged by our own sufferings what must be the fate of the Resolution, that was
                    much less able to struggle with the storm than the Discovery. The storm
                    continuing with sleet and snow, three men could scarce do the work of one.</p>
                <p>Amidst these complicated distresses, our leak increased to an alarming
                    degree.</p>
                <p>On the 28th, we made 17 inches in three hours. The wind dying away, we tried the
                    current, and found we drifted half a mile an hour to the Southward. A man was
                    sent up to the mast-head, to look round for the Resolution, but without
                    succeeding. We now gave her over for lost.</p>
                <p>On the 29th, we stood in for the land, and at two in the afternoon, we came in
                    sight of the entrance of the bay of Kamshatska, then distant between seven and
                    eight miles to the Southward. We made sail, and stood right in; but finding it
                    froze <pb n="322"/> over, we judged that the Resolution could not possibly be
                    there, and therefore concluded that she must have gone to the bottom.</p>
                <p> Early next morning, we once more attempted the entrance of the bay, and finding
                    the ice drifted, we conceived hopes that we might be able to force a passage
                    through the loose ice, which, now the weather was fine, did not appear so
                    formidable as before. About noon, a pleasant breeze sprung up, and we directed
                    our course to a flag we saw displayed just within the bay, and happily
                    succeeded, drooping our anchor in twenty fathom water, within less than three
                    leagues of our intended harbour. In about half an hour, while our boats were
                    still looking out for a passage, we observed at a distance two boats making
                    towards us, one of which we knew to belong to the Resolution; the other
                    belonged to the Russians. No joy could exceed that which the certainty of the
                    safety of the Resolution spread through the whole ship's company of the
                    Discovery. She had been in port ever since the 27th, and had given us over for
                    lost, never expecting to see us more. She had met with some damage in her sails
                    and rigging; but by her fortunately hitting the harbour, she had escaped much of
                    the distress that we suffered from the severity of the weather.</p>
                <p>Early on the first of May, we weighed, having the Resolution's boat to direct us.
                    Soon after day-light, we were within the light-house near the entrance of the
                    harbour, but were opposed by a strong tide from the shore, which drifting huge
                    pieces of floating ice against us, made our further progress both dangerous and
                    fatiguing but, having the wind fair, about five in the evening we came to in
                    sight of the town, and soon after dropt anchor near the Resolution.</p>
                <pb n="323"/>
                <p>On the 2d, the Resolution unmoored, and both ships came to, and moored within a
                    mile of the town, and within a cable's length of the ice, which entirely shut up
                    the head of the bay.—Here we found only one small sloop, about fifty tons,
                    which, as soon as the ice was clear, was bound on a trading voyage to the
                    Northward.—We had no sooner dropt anchor than our boat was ordered out, and our
                    Captain, with several other gentlemen, went to visit Capt. Clerke, and to take
                    his orders for our future proceedings. We found him still growing weaker and
                    weaker; we therefore shortened our stay.</p>
                <p>On the 3d, some of the principal officers and gentlemen went on shore, and were
                    received by a subaltern, who now had the command of the fort, situated close by
                    a little miserable town, called St. Peter and St. Paul, which, by its
                    appearance, could not be supposed to furnish provisions for the ships crew a
                    single week. We soon learnt that the Governor lived at a town called
                    Bolcheritsk, distant about 135 miles; and that an express had been sent to him
                    on the 29th, about noon, in a sledge drawn by dogs, to notify our arrival. The
                    subaltern, in the mean time, shewed us every civility. We found on our landing
                    a sledge drawn by dogs, in readiness to receive our Commander, and to conduct
                    him to the residence of the officer already mentioned, where he found some
                    gentlemen belonging to the Resolution. It was not, however, a little strange,
                    that though we were expected, and that the Empress of Russia had given orders
                    to her Governor to furnish us with every accommodation in his power, that not a
                    person was to be found that understood any other language than that of the
                    natives of the place, and of Russia; neither of which languages was
                    intelligible to <pb n="324"/> any of us; so that, having no interpreter, every
                    thing was to be conducted by signs.</p>
                <p>They were hospitably received, and entertained with stewed fish, venison-soups,
                    and other dishes, dressed after the manner of the country; and the officer who
                    now had the command, behaved with an uncommon degree of civility, or, more
                    properly, servility, by paying every attention that his circumstances would
                    admit, to make the Commodore's situation tolerable. He had made him understand,
                    that at the distance of about sixteen wrests, at a town called Paratounka, there
                    lived a priest, who might possibly be able to converse with him; and with that
                    view, he, the very next day, sent an express to invite him to the fort, at the
                    same time intimating that the Governor was a German, who could talk all
                    languages, which accounts for the omission before complained of: and indeed, as
                    it afterwards appeared, we were expected here the preceding summer, and that our
                    arrival was now unlooked for. On board, the carpenters were busy in stripping
                    the ships bows, where they found the leak of the Resolution to have been chiefly
                    seated. The larboard bow had been stript of its sheathing, and the oakum had
                    been washed out. The sailors were employed in getting the sick on shore, with
                    every part of the ships stores that stood in need of revisal; and though the
                    weather continued piercing cold, no time was lost in forwarding the repairs.</p>
                <p>On the 4th, one of our boats, in putting the astronomer's assistant on shore at
                    the influx of the tide, was suddenly encircled by the floating ice, in such a
                    manner as not to be able to move one way or the other; another boat, sent to her
                    relief, was soon enclosed in the same manner, and till Page 325 the return of
                    the tide, both were forced to remain in that deplorable situation, not a person
                    on board daring to trust himself among the floating ice, to go to their
                    assistance. About twelve at night they were released, and the icey prisoners
                    returned on board, almost perished with cold.</p>
                <p>A still worse accident happened to Lieut. King, the ingenious writer of the third
                    volume of Cook's voyage, on his first attempt to land; for having no clue to
                    direct him to the village before him, in passing the trackless snow and ice, the
                    ice broke under him, and for a moment he disappeared. Providentially he rose
                    again clear; and the man who attended him having a boat-hook in his hand,
                    instantly threw it to him; he catched it, and laying it across two pieces of
                    ice, recovered his footing.</p>
                <p>On the 5th, six gentlemen arrived from Bolcheritsk, among whom was a merchant
                    who came to trade for skins; some of which he purchased from us, as we thought,
                    at great prices; but as we afterwards found, for little more than half their
                    value. These are all monopolized by the Russian Company, already mentioned in
                    our account of the last summer's voyage, and not a skin is to be had from the
                    Kamshatskadales. This gentleman was accompanied by the Governor's Secretary, who
                    could speak both German and Dutch, and who brought a letter from the Governor,
                    written in German, complimenting the Commodore on his arrival, tendering his
                    best services, and excusing his absence; adding, at the same time, that when he
                    was made acquainted with the necessaries of which we stood in need, he would
                    give immediate orders for their supply, as far as was in his power; and that he
                    would embrace the first opportunity of waiting upon the Commodore. It <pb
                        n="326"/> happened that Mr. Webber, our draughtsman, was master of the
                    German; and on reading the letter, it was judged more respectful, as well as
                    more suitable to the occasion, for Capt. Gore, our Commander, and Lieut. King,
                    of the Resolution, to be messengers, as they could give a more particular
                    account of our many wants than could possibly be transmitted in a letter.</p>
                <p>On the 6th the Ruffian gentlemen were entertained on board the ships, Mr. Webber
                    acting as interpreter to the merchant, and the governor's secretary
                    understanding a little French, was well enough understood to make the
                    conversation and the bottle pass jovially round. About ten at night the company
                    parted; and, In the morning of the 7th, Capt. Gore, attended by Lieut. King of
                    the Resolution and Mr. Webber, and accompanied by the merchant and Ruffian
                    secretary, set out for Bolcheritsk (Bolcheraika says our Journalist, mistaking
                    the name of the river for the name of the town) where, after a most fatiguing
                    journey, they arrived on the 13th, and were received by Major Behm the
                    Governor, with a politeness that did honour to the post he filled.</p>
                <p>After the usual salutations, they entered into general conversation, when our
                    gentlemen soon discovered that the Major was not only a man of breeding, but of
                    general knowledge; that he had been made acquainted by his court with our
                    intention of touching at Kamshatska; that the character of our first Commander,
                    Capt. Cook was known to him by the historical relations of his former
                    expeditions; and that the whole route, that he was supposed to pursue in the
                    present expedition, he had deduced from his own observations, aided by the
                    charts and maps of which he <pb n="327"/> was himself in possession. Capt. Gore,
                    when he came to speak of our North-west course, put the letter into his hands,
                    which our Commodore received from the Ruffian Ismyloff at Samganuida, (of which
                    notice has already been taken;) and which chiefly related to the business of the
                    factory, having only slightly touched upon the civilities he had received from
                    us, and had represented us as interlopers, or merchant-boats, engaged in a new
                    line of commerce, which he apprehended might be injurious to that in which the
                    factory was engaged. The Governor, however, was of too liberal a turn of mind to
                    be at all affected by such an ill-founded opinion; but had he been inclined to
                    give ear to this uncandid insinuation, or to the natural jealousy and distrust
                    of the Kamtschatskadales, (for they had not yet got rid of the panic with which
                    they were seized at our first approach,) an incident had just happened, that
                    would have infallibly established their credit. The reader will recollect, that
                    in passing Beering's Straits, the ships touched at a town on the Asiatic coast,
                    inhabited by the Tschutskoi nation, a race of stout hardy men, totally different
                    from the Americans on the opposite side of the Straits. This nation had hitherto
                    maintained their independence, and had resisted all the attempts of the Ruffians
                    to reduce them The last expedition against them in 1750, terminated in the
                    defeat of the Ruffians, who from that time had removed their frontier fortress
                    from the Anadyr to the Ingiga, a river that empties itself into the sea of
                    Okotsk. From this fort, the Governor received dispatches the day of the arrival
                    of our officers at Bolcheritsk, containing intelligence, that a tribe of the
                    Tschutskoi had arrived at that place with propositions of <pb n="328"/>
                    friendship, and voluntary offer of tribute; that on enquiring into this
                    unexpected alteration in their sentiments, they had informed his people, that
                    towards the letter end of the last summer they had been visited by two very
                    large Ruffian boats, that they had been treated by the people who were in them
                    with the greatest kindness, and had entered into a league of friendship and
                    amity with them; and that relying on this friendly disposition, they are now
                    come to the Ruffian fort, in order to settle a treaty on such terms as might be
                    acceptable to both nations. This extraordinary history had occasioned much
                    speculation, both at Ingeginsk and Bolcheritsk; and had not our gentlemen
                    furnished them with a key to it, must have remained perfectly unintelligible:
                    they felt, however, no small satisfaction at being able to clear up the mystery:
                    with which too the Governor was no less pleased than instructed.</p>
                <p> By this time dinner was ready, and the gentlemen were invited to partake of
                    what had been provided; they would have excused themselves on account of dress,
                    but the Governor would admit no apology.</p>
                <p>After dinner they took occasion to deliver to the Governor their instructions,
                    with a list of those articles of which the ships stood most in need;
                    representing at the same time the shattered condition of the ships, and how
                    much they were in want of sails and cordage, as well as provisions, having met
                    with no supply of beef or bread from the time they left England in 1776, to the
                    present day; nor of tobacco, a chief article with our sailors, though for three
                    months they had been under the necessity of subsisting without. The Governor
                    heard him with attention, and being sensible that the gentlemen must be <pb
                        n="329"/> fatigued, and desirous of rest, begged he might be permitted to
                    conduct them to the house prepared for their residence during their stay, where
                    they found every thing provided for them in the nicest order; and a house-keeper
                    and cook; a serjeant, two sentinels, and an interpreter allowed for their
                    domestics. These civilities were accompanied with the most lively expressions
                    of esteem, at parting; and in the morning, when the gentlemen rose, they found
                    their wishes anticipated by an order lying on their table, ready to be
                    forwarded to the subaltern at the fort, to supply the ships with the articles
                    they most wanted, without regard to their being wanted by the garrison.</p>
                <p>The gentlemen were not more gratified than astonished, at finding the spirit of a
                    prince in a Governor sent to the remotest corner of the earth to preside over a
                    semi-barbarous people, living in a district the most deplorable and
                    uncultivated; but they were still more surprised, when, upon enquiring as to the
                    price of the several articles they stood in need of, they were told, that
                    nothing more was required of them, than an attestation of those things being
                    received which should be in his power to furnish, in justification of his own
                    conduct, in not having been wanting in duty to his Sovereign, whose commands he
                    had received, to exert his utmost endeavours to contribute every assistance to
                    promote a design so liberally set on foot by her favourite ally the King of
                    Great-Britain.</p>
                <p>And recollecting that tobacco was an article highly prized by the mariners, and
                    not to be purchased, at any price in his district, our gentlemen, before their
                    departure from Bolcheritsk, found a quantity, not less than 400 weight,
                    deposited in their house, "labelled as a present to the seamen <pb n="330"/> on
                    board the ships;" and another bag containing 20 pounds of tea, and 20 loaves of
                    sugar, as the present from the Governor's lady to the officers; along with these
                    she had likewise sent a present of fresh butter, honey, figs, rice, &amp;c. for
                    Capt. Clerke, with her good wishes for the recovery of his health.</p>
                <p>We should be wanting therefore in justice to this worthy Governor, were we to
                    pass over his behaviour to us unnoticed; which was such as did honour to his
                    feelings as a man, and to her Imperial Majesty as an officer.</p>
                <p> Our gentlemen, after being entertained in a most magnificent manner for several
                    days, was accompanied in their return by the Governor himself; who, after
                    enforcing his orders for our immediate supply from the country, came to see
                    that his orders had been obeyed at the fort. He had already ordered 13,000
                    weight of meal to be collected from different districts at a great distance,
                    and conveyed to us at whatever expence, accompanied with 20 head of horned
                    cattle. These our sailors rejoiced to see, and, though skeletons compared with
                    those of England, were received by us with an eagerness not easily to be
                    exceeded; for not having had the relish of fresh beef for more than three years,
                    the very scrapings of the bones would have been to our sailors, at this time, a
                    treat infinitely more grateful, than at home they would have thought the most
                    luxurious feast.</p>
                <p>On the 16th, while the gentlemen were still at Bolcheritsk, a small bullock,
                    procured by the serjeant of the fort, was killed, and divided between the crews
                    of both ships. The same evening, John M'Intosh, the carpenter, mate of the
                    Resolution died, and was decently buried, and the aged priest at Parantounka
                    attending.</p>
                <pb n="331"/>
                <p>It was the 23d before the Governor and officers arrived at Paratounka, in the
                    vicinage of which the priest resided, of whom we have already spoken. With him
                    the Governor spent the afternoon, but when night came he slept at the fort, if
                    fort a mere log-house could be called, without either gun or platform to place a
                    gun.</p>
                <p>On the 25th the pinnace from the Resolution was manned, and properly equipped to
                    bring him on board. He was saluted with 13 guns from the Resolution, and 11 from
                    the Discovery; and when he entered the ship he was received with music, and with
                    all the honours that circumstances would admit; and he was so well pleased with
                    his reception, that he staid two days and two nights on board: during which
                    time, Capt. Clerke being ill, committed the care of entertaining him to the
                    officers with whom he was acquainted, who did not fail to make it agreeable.
                    Some very noble presents were made him at his departure, consisting of
                    curiosities collected from every part of the world, with a gold watch, two
                    fowling-pieces, a brace of silver-mounted pistols, and other valuable articles
                    of English manufacture; to all which were added, near 100 gallons of brandy from
                    the ships stores, as a present from the sailors out of their allowance, they
                    having, at their own request, desired that so much should be spared out of their
                    allowance for grog, in lieu of the tobacco that his Excellency had generously
                    ordered to be divided amongst them gratis; tobacco at that time had been in
                    such estimation, that he who had been provident enough to make a reserve, sold
                    it nearly at the price of silver.</p>
                <p>Orders were now given to get every thing on board, and prepare for sailing as
                    fast as possible: both ships had been stripped of their sheathing <pb n="332"/>
                    to the water's edge, but the leak of the Discovery was found much lower, being
                    a hole worn in her bow, which, had not the hull been cleared, could never have
                    been come at.</p>
                <p>Having now got the meal on board, the crews were served with an allowance of half
                    rye and half flour; which, however, not being accustomed to, they did not very
                    well relish, though it was found to be very wholesome. The Governor had made
                    Capt. Clerke a present of a cow, for which it was necessary to provide
                    provender; and large quantities of ducks, geese and poultry were taken on board,
                    to supply the want of other live stock; for here they had no sheep, nor any
                    other domestic animal, except dogs, which serve the natives both for horses
                    and hunting: nor was there a cow in the country, that we saw, except what the
                    Governor sent to Capt. Clerke, and one in possession of the priest. What was
                    remarkable, though the sea seemed almost covered with wild ducks, and sea-fowl
                    of various sorts, they were all so shy, that very few were killed.</p>
                <p>We had now been here a month, when, On the 4th of June, being his Majesty's
                    birthday, the same was celebrated with great magnificence on board and on
                    shore. The ships were dressed with streamers, and with the colours of all
                    nations, and a flag was displayed at the tents. The Russian gentlemen were
                    sumptuously entertained, on board, and the common men were served with double
                    allowance of meat and liquor; and being permitted to divert themselves on shore,
                    many of them made parties, and traversed the woods in pursuit of game, with
                    which they were told the country abounded. But, as they were ignorant of their
                    haunts, they met with no success.</p>
                <pb n="333"/>
                <p>Before our departure, packets were entrusted to the care of the Governor, to be
                    forwarded to England by the way of Petersburgh, both for government and to
                    private friends; these we have since been informed were carefully transmitted.
                    And now, having all things in readiness, our full complement of wood and water
                    on board, and of every necessary the country afforded, and waiting only for a
                    wind, Early on the 12th of June we weighed, and sailed, directing our course to
                    the northward; but were detained in the bay till The 15th, when we were alarmed
                    with a noise louder than the loudest thunder, and presently were almost blinded
                    with the fall of ashes, which in less than an hour, covered the decks all over
                    from stern to stern, an inch thick; among which were mixed pumice-stones as
                    large as walnuts, and many smaller stones, which seemed to have received no
                    alteration by fire. We were all driven down between decks, but about ten in the
                    morning were released by the shower ceasing. On looking round, we found they
                    issued from a volcano at the distance, as we supposed, of about twenty miles,
                    then bearing from us W. S. W. During this eruption, we were not only obliged to
                    retire ourselves, but to fasten down the hatches fore and aft; so that what with
                    the closeness of our confinement, and the sulphureous fumes from the ashes, we
                    were almost suffocated. We were therefore no sooner released, than we weighed
                    anchor and steered to the eastward.</p>
                <p>On the 17th and 18th we continued our course E. and E. by N. On the 19th steered
                    E. by N. Lat. 54.56.</p>
                <p>On the 20th came in sight of land, high, and covered with snow, called by
                    Beering, Kronotskoi-noss, <pb n="334"/> but found that Cape a degree more to
                    the southward than he had laid it down. Lat. 55.52.</p>
                <p>On the 21st we continued to steer E. N. E. came in sight of Kamtschatska-noss,
                    saw a dead whale, two seals, and a number of sea-lions.</p>
                <p>On the 22d we stood to the N. E. and, seeing a change in the colour of the water,
                    we sounded, but found no ground at 100 fathom. We continued the same course
                    till the 25th, when we were in lat. 59.9. and long. 168.30. E.</p>
                <p>On the 26th we changed our course E. N. E. and finding the sea covered with gulls
                    and shags, we sounded, but found no ground at 120 fathom.</p>
                <p>On the 27th we stood E. one-half N. and found ourselves by observation in lat.
                    59.57. long 17. E. We changed our course and stood N. N. W.</p>
                <p>On the 28th, early in the morning, we came in sight of land, very high and
                    covered with snow, the extreme point of which bore N. E. distance about 6
                    leagues. We continued our course along shore, with regular soundings at about 54
                    fathom, free from reefs, and a very bold shore. We steered this course till The
                    30th, at noon, when we were in lat. 62.1. Thadeus's Noss came in sight, beyond
                    which the coast seemed to stretch directly North. Here it is observable, that on
                    the Asiatic coast, the sea near the shore is everywhere of a convenient depth
                    for sailing; while on the opposite shore it continues so shallow for several
                    degrees together, as not to be navigated but with the utmost caution.</p>
                <p>On the 1st of July, the weather began to grow hazy, with thick fogs. We shaped
                    our course for the point in our chart, called Tschutkoski-Noss, which with that
                    of Thadeus, form the N. E. and S. W. points of the gulph of Anadyr.</p>
                <pb n="335"/>
                <p>The 3d in the morning, when the fogs left us and it began to rain. At ten in the
                    morning, saw a very high point of land, bearing from us N. N. E. distance about
                    7 leagues. We hauled upon a wind, and stood E. N. E. till two in the afternoon,
                    when we passed a small island, called by the Russians St. Nicholas; in some
                    parts very high and covered with snow. Lat. 63.45. long. 187.</p>
                <p>On the 4th at one in the morning, we bore away N. ½ E. and about noon, the next
                    day, saw land from W. to N. E. appearing like two islands. These were the
                    islands of St. Diomede, in the midway between the two Continents. At four
                    o'clock we hauled up to W. N. W. being near the East Cape of the Asiatic
                    Continent, and sounding from 26 to 29 fathom. At ten at night, the weather being
                    clear, we had an opportunity of seeing the remarkable peeked hill near Cape
                    Prince of Wales, on the American side, and the East Cape of Asia, with the two
                    connecting islands of St. Diomede between them.</p>
                <p>On the 6th we continued coasting from N. ½ W. to N. ½ E. with the land to the
                    westward high and snowy. Lat. 67.10. long. 191. E. On the 7th, saw ice in a
                    large body to the eastward, distance about 2 or 3 leagues, and about noon
                    passed several large masses of ice. We tacked and stood N. W. by W. with a stiff
                    gale and heavy snow.</p>
                <p>On the 8th fell in with the ice again in a solid body; at the same time bore away
                    S. S. W.</p>
                <p>On the 9th, at three in the morning, we hauled up along side the solid ice,
                    freezing cold all day. Lat. 69.12.</p>
                <p>On the 10th continued our course all the morning, and at nine passed a large
                    field of loose ice, <pb n="336"/> distance about three miles, and at noon went
                    through it.</p>
                <p>On the 11th we found ourselves surrounded with ice. We kept working to the S. E.
                    passing many large fields of ice, covered with sea-cows. We kept luffing up and
                    bearing away, till with some difficulty we got through. Lat. by observation
                    67.40. long. 188.40. We continued working through the ice till The 14th, when by
                    observation we were in lat. 69.37. We continued bearing away to the northward,
                    till The 18th, when by observation we were in lat. 70.28. long. 194.54. and
                    being very near the ice, a large white bear passed us in the water, but made for
                    the ice at a great rate. In half an hour, we saw multitudes of them upon the
                    ice, making to the eastward, when we observed the sea-cows, as the bears
                    approached them, flying like sheep pursued by dogs.</p>
                <p>On the 20th we came in sight of land at the distance of about 5 or 6 leagues,
                    bearing from S. to S. E. sounded from 24 to 21 fathom. Our course being W. ½ S.
                    all the morning, at 3 P. M. we altered it, and stood to the southward and
                    westward. This day the crew of the Resolution had the good fortune to fall in
                    with two large white bears, and to kill them both, the two fore tusks of the
                    largest weighed 436lb.</p>
                <p>On the 21st we stood from W. ½ N. to W. N. W. and at six o'clock we passed a
                    large island of ice, on which were whole herds of sea-cows of an enormous size.
                    We fired several muskets among them, which sent them to the water with dreadful
                    yellings. At nine in the evening we came in sight of the American shore, distant
                    about six leagues. We steered all night W. by N. and next <pb n="337"/> morning
                    found ourselves almost surrounded with fields of ice drifting to the southward.
                    At twelve o'clock we hauled our wind to the southward, and, by the alertness of
                    our seamen, we passed them with very little damage.</p>
                <p>On the 22d, about two A M. we again stood S. S. W. but at six saw the ice all
                    round us from S. E. to N. W. hauled our wind upon our larboard tack, and stood
                    S. S. E. We were all this day luffing up and bearing away to avoid the ice,
                    which was on every side in sight, in many frightful shapes. On the morning of
                    the 23d it came on to blow very hard, and, before noon, we found ourselves
                    closely blocked up in the ice, and could see it all round us in a solid body, to
                    a great distance. At the same time we saw the Resolution bearing N. E. ½ E. some
                    miles off, which was the last sight we had of her during the whole day. In this
                    horrid situation we handed all our sails, unbent our fore-top-sail, and moored
                    ship with both our ice anchors, one to each bow.</p>
                <p>We now began to reflect on our condition; the winter drawing on apace; our
                    provisions short, and what we had but very indifferent, and no relief to be
                    expected; our people's spirits began to sink, and it was with difficulty that
                    they were persuaded to exert themselves for their own deliverance. Fortunately
                    for us, we had, in the evening, a shift of wind from W. N. W. with a steady
                    breeze, when our Captain, looking over our starboard quarter, discerned the ice
                    to the southward, seemingly to leave the ship, and soon heard a crash, as if a
                    thousand rocks had been rent from their foundations; which we afterwards
                    perceived to be the parting of the ice in different directions, and soon after
                    found ourselves released. We instantly <pb n="338"/> got up our ice-anchors,
                    and shaped our course from S. E. to E. S. E. but were frequently stopped by
                    large pieces, which carried away great part of our sheathing forward, and
                    damaged our stern, so that the ship made water at the rate of three inches and a
                    half an hour; and at the same time had 37 inches in her well.</p>
                <p>On the 24th we continued our course E. S. E. and came in fight of the Resolution,
                    which had likewise received much damage about her bows. We were now clear of the
                    ice, and, till three in the afternoon, sailed in company, till we came up with a
                    solid body of ice, on which we saw a number of amphibious animals, some of them
                    very large. We instantly got out and manned our boats, and in three hours
                    returned with eleven of the largest, about which all hands were employed the
                    next day in skinning and cutting them up for blubber.</p>
                <p>On the 25th we passed several fields of ice. We steered N. E. one-half E. and at
                    noon was at the extreme of the easternmost land in sight, being then in lat.
                    69.12. and, by lunar observation, in long. 187.16. East of London. It was now
                    excessive cold; the snow froze as it fell. The blocks were choaked up, and the
                    ropes increased by the frost to double their real size. In this condition it is
                    easy to conceive, the fatigues to which the poor sailors were exposed; yet by a
                    little encouragement, increasing their allowance of grog, and giving them
                    plenty of provisions, they continued their labour with cheerfulness and
                    astonishing perseverance.</p>
                <p>On the 27th we found ourselves involved again among the loose ice, some of which
                    it was out of our power to escape; and the leak still continuing rather to
                    increase than abate, our Captain, with <pb n="339"/> Mr. Bailey the astronomer,
                    and Mr. Burney, our first Lieutenant, went on board the Resolution, to report
                    our situation to the Commodore, whom they found so ill as to be past all hopes
                    of recovery. Upon calling a council of officers, it was unanimously agreed,
                    that we should proceed as fast as possible to some port, where we might repair
                    our damages, and Kamshatska was appointed our place of rendezvous. We were now
                    in lat. 68.10. and in long. 188. shaping our course S. E. with a light breeze
                    from W. S. W.</p>
                <p> On the 28th, at two in the morning we came in sight of the Asiatic shore, very
                    high and covered with snow, distance about 7 or 8 leagues, we made sail and
                    stood to the southward. About noon we found ourselves in lat. 67.11. by double
                    altitudes, and in long. 188.10. E. the extreme of the easternmost end of the
                    ice distant about 6 leagues. At ten at night we saw a great number of ducks,
                    geese, and sea-parrots very near us, by which we judged land could not be far
                    off.</p>
                <p>On the 29th at noon we were in lat. 66.50. and long. 188.27. but no land in
                    sight.</p>
                <p>On the 30th we steered till noon to the S. E. with a steady breeze, and came in
                    sight of two islands right a-head, distant about five or six leagues. The
                    weather then became thick and hazy, and though we were certain that the main
                    land of Asia and America were at no great distance, we could see neither till
                    about four o'clock in the afternoon; when the weather clearing up, we saw a
                    passage or streight, to which we bore away, and found the two continents at
                    seven o'clock on each side of us. Lat. 66. thirteen leagues asunder, beyond
                    which they diverge to N. E. by E. and W. N. W. so as, in lat. 69. to be 300
                    miles asunder. This streight we called <pb n="340"/> North streight, the
                    entrance of which we found the same as has been already described; and the
                    current at this time setting to the N. W. very strong, made our passage not only
                    difficult but dangerous. We shaped our course S. S. W. and continued the same
                    the whole night, sounding from 22 to 26 fathom, grey sand and small shells.</p>
                <p>On the 31st we passed Tschutuskoi-noss, called by the sailors Tuskan-noss, and
                    soon came in sight of Cook's town, which we visited the last season, as has
                    already been mentioned, and which we now passed with regret. On the 1st of
                    August we were in lat. 64.23. long. 189.15. the coast of Asia extending from N.
                    W. by W. distant about 12 leagues.</p>
                <p> Nothing remarkable till August the 5th, when we had an observation, and found
                    ourselves in lat. 63.37.</p>
                <p>On the 7th at noon we were by observation in lat. 59.38. and in long. 183.45. and
                    at no great distance from the land. At four o'clock having a dead calm, the
                    companies of both ships employed themselves in fishing, and very fortunately
                    caught a great number of large cod, which were equally distributed among the
                    crews. To this place we gave the name of the bank of Good Providence; and as
                    soon as the breeze sprung up, we made sail and stood to S. W.</p>
                <p>On the 9th at noon, we were by observation in lat. 57. and long. 183.36.14. The
                    weather being more moderate than it had been for several days, the signal was
                    made to speak with the Resolution, when on enquiry, we were informed that the
                    Captain was past recovery, and that the crew began to grow sickly. At this time
                    we had not one man on the sick list on board the Discovery.</p>
                <pb n="341"/>
                <p>On the 10th we continued our course S. W. by W. and on the 12th at noon having
                    had contrary winds, we were in lat. 56.37. with the ship's head to the S. W.</p>
                <p>In the evening of the 13th we had the Resolution's boat on board, to compare
                    time, who brought the disagreeable news of the Captain's being given over by the
                    surgeon.</p>
                <p>On the 15th being in soundings, and the weather calm, we hove to, in order to
                    get some fish for the sick, and a few cod were caught and sent on board the
                    Resolution to be distributed accordingly.</p>
                <p> On the 17th the wind that had been against us for some days past shifted in our
                    favour; and at nine in the morning the man at the mast-head called out land to
                    the N. W. which was found to be the island of Mednor, laid down to the S. E. of
                    Beering Island, lat. at noon. 54.50.</p>
                <p> Nothing remarkable till the 21st, when early in the morning the man at the
                    mast-head again came in sight of land. It was then at a very great distance, and
                    upon our starboard bow, but before night we were only distant from the mouth of
                    Kamshatska bay, 12 or 13 leagues.</p>
                <p>On the 22d at nine in the morning we had the Resolution's boat on board, to
                    acquaint our Captain with the death of our Commodore. We were then within sight
                    of the flag, at the mouth of Kamshatska-bay, of which mention has already been
                    made; and the wind being favourable, we continued our course for the entrance of
                    the harbour, which then bore from us W. S. W. lat. at noon 52.24.</p>
                <p>On the 23d a little before midnight, we came to anchor within the
                    light-house.</p>
                <pb n="342"/>
                <p>On the 24th our Captain, being now Commodore, made the signal to get under way
                    by towing; all the boats were accordingly got out, and the Commodore went on
                    board the Resolution, where it was resolved, for the greater convenience of
                    repairing the ships, and for erecting the tents and forge, to go within the
                    upper harbour. And about four in the afternoon both ships came to, and were
                    moored in three fathom and a half water, muddy bottom.</p>
                <p>The old serjeant, who still commanded at the fort, came with a present of berries
                    for Capt. Clerke. He seemed much affected when he was shewn his coffin, and was
                    told it was his particular desire to be buried on shore.</p>
                <p>Early next morning the tents were erected, and the sick were put on shore.</p>
                <p>From the time we set sail out of this bay in June, till the present day, we had
                    been in no harbour to refit; and had been driven from island to island among
                    the ice, till our ships had in a manner lost their sheathing, and were
                    otherwise in a shattered condition; we were therefore happy in arriving
                    safe.</p>
                <p>August 25th, an express was sent to Bolcheritsk, to acquaint the new governor,
                    Capt. Shmaleff, with our arrival, and with the death of our late Commander, at
                    the same time requesting a fresh supply of cattle. Another express was sent to
                    Paratounka, to desire the attendance of the priest, in order to consult with him
                    concerning the interment of Capt. Clerke, whose desire was, to be buried in his
                    church. While we were waiting the issue of these messages, the several
                    promotions took place that followed in consequence of the Commander's death.
                    Mr. Gore went on board the Resolution, and Mr. King, first Lieut. <pb n="343"/>
                    of the Resolution, took the command of the Discovery. Other promotions took
                    place, which the reader will remark by the sequel. The first care of the
                    commanders of both ships was to provide for the recovery of the sick, and the
                    repairs of the ships; and for that purpose a house was procured for the
                    reception of the former, and a contrivance made for having the latter dry.</p>
                <p>The weather being now temperate and the country delightful, the officers and
                    gentlemen chose to sleep in their marquees on shore. It was however thought
                    expedient to shew every mark of respect to the Russian officers, who, though not
                    of the first rank, were notwithstanding the only people with whom we had any
                    concern, or with whom we could have any communication; they were therefore
                    frequently invited to dinner, and they often attended.</p>
                <p>On the 26th the priest arrived, when Capt. Gore acquainted him with the death of
                    our commander, and of his desire to be buried in his church. The good old
                    gentleman seemed much concerned, but started several difficulties, and appeared
                    very unwilling to comply with the dying request of the deceased. He urged
                    several reasons to shew the impropriety of it; those of most weight were, that
                    the church was soon to be pulled down; that it was every winter three feet deep
                    in water; and that in a few years no vestige of it would remain, as the new
                    church was to be erected near the town of Awatska, upon a drier and more
                    convenient spot. He therefore advised the remains of the Commander to be
                    deposited at the foot of a tree, the scite of which was to be included in the
                    body of the new church, where the Captain's bones might <pb n="344"/> probably
                    rest for ages undisturbed. These reasons, whether real or fictitious, the
                    officers who had charge of the funeral could not disprove, and therefore people
                    were sent to dig the grave where the priest should direct.</p>
                <p>All hands were now busy at work on their different employments. The Discovery,
                    on being examined, was found to be in a most wretched condition; many of her
                    timbers beneath the wale shaken, and some of her planks rotten, and for want of
                    others to supply their places, were forced to be shifted.</p>
                <p>The 29th was appointed for the interment; and to make the funeral the more
                    solemn, every officer was desired to appear in his uniform; the marines to be
                    drawn up under arms, and the common men to be dressed as nearly alike as
                    possible, in order to attend the corpse from the water-side to the grave. All
                    this was readily complied with, and the procession began about ten in the
                    morning, when minute guns from the ships were fired, and the drums, muffled as
                    usual, beat the dead march. When the corpse arrived at the grave, it was
                    deposited under the triple discharge of the marines; and, the grave being
                    covered, it was fenced in by piles driven deep in the ground, and the inside
                    afterwards filled up with stones and earth, to preserve the body from being
                    devoured in the winter by bears or other wild beasts, who are remarkable for
                    their sagacity in scenting out the bodies of dead passengers, when they happen
                    to perish and are buried near the roads.</p>
                <p>This ceremony over, an escutcheon was prepared and neatly painted by Mr. Webber,
                    with the Captain's coat of arms properly emblazon'd, and placed in the church of
                    Paratounka, and underneath the following inscription: <pb n="345"/> There lies
                    interred at the Foot of a Tree, near the Ostrog of St. PETER, and PAUL, The BODY
                    of CHARLES CLERKE, ESQUIRE, COMMANDER of his Britannic Majesty's Ships the

                    deg. 40 min. 57 sec. N. in search of a North-west Passage from EUROPE to the
                    EAST-INDIES. The Second Attempt being made by CAPTAIN CLERKE, who sailed within
                    some few Leagues of Captain Cook; but was brought up by a solid Body of Ice,
                    which he found from the American to the Asia shore, and almost trended due East
                    and West.—He died at Sea, on his Return to the Southward, on the 22d Day of
                    AUGUST, 1779. AGED, 38 Years.</p>
                <pb n="346"/>
                <p>Another inscription was fixed upon the tree under which he was interred. This
                    tree was at some distance from the town, and near the hospital, round which
                    several people had already been buried; but none so high upon the hill as the
                    spot pointed out for the grave of Capt. Clerke. The inscription placed on this
                    tree was nearly the same as that in the church of Paratounka, and was as
                    follows: Beneath this Tree lies the BODY of CAPTAIN CHARLES CLERKE, COMMANDER of
                    his Britannic Majesty's Ships the Resolution and Discovery, Which Command he
                    succeeded to on the 14th of February, 1779, on the Death of Captain JAMES COOK,
                    Who was killed by the Natives of some Islands he discovered in the SOUTH SEA, on
                    the Date above. CAPTAIN CLERKE died at Sea, of a lingering Illness, on the 22d
                    Day of AUGUST, 1779, In the 38th year of his AGE. And was INFERRED on the 30th
                    following.</p>
                <pb n="347"/>
                <p>On this occasion the inhabitants of both towns, and those of the whole country
                    for many miles round, attended; and the crews of both ships were suffered to
                    continue ashore, and to divert themselves, each as he liked best. It was the
                    Captain's desire that they should have double allowance for three days
                    successively, and all that while to be excused from other duty than what the
                    ordinary attendance in the ships required; but the season being far advanced,
                    and a long track of unknown sea to pass before we could reach China, the
                    officers representing the hardships and inconveniencies that so much lost time
                    might bring upon themselves, they very readily gave up that part of the
                    Captain's bequest, and returned to their respective employments early the next
                    day.</p>
                <p>On the 4th of September, an Ensign arrived with a letter from the Governor to
                    Capt. Gore, acquainting him, that orders had been given about the cattle; that
                    the bearer was to remain, to take care that nothing should be wanted that the
                    garrison could supply; and that on the arrival of a sloop from Okotzk, which was
                    daily expected, he would himself supply his place.</p>
                <p>The Ensign farther informed Capt. Gore, that the sloop was laden with provisions
                    and stores of all sorts for the use of the ships; but expressed some
                    apprehensions for her safety, as the boats had been looking out for her several
                    days. This news was of too much importance to be slighted. Accordingly, On the
                    3d the pinnaces and beats from both ships were sent to the entrance of the bay,
                    to assist, in case she should be in sight, in towing her 〈◊〉 but it was <pb
                        n="348"/> The 11th before she arrived. She was a bark of about 80 tons, and
                    had two guns mounted, which she fired as a salute, when she dropt anchor, and
                    was answered by a volley from the garrison, which consisted of a subaltern and
                    twenty-five soldiers. She was no sooner moored, than we received a visit from a
                    Put-parochich, or Sub-Lieutenant, who was to take the command of the fort. He
                    was introduced to the Commodore, to whom he delivered the invoice of his lading;
                    among which were wearing apparel and tobacco, two articles that were above all
                    others acceptable to the ships companies.</p>
                <p>As soon as the Lieutenant had executed his commission, and delivered up the
                    stores to the Commodore, he took his leave, and returned to Bolcheritsk; and the
                    ships being lightened afore, and their bows heaved up dry, so that the
                    carpenters could get at the leaks, the Captains and principal officers finding
                    little else to amuse them, made a party to scour the woods for game; but this
                    proved the worst season in the year for hunting. They had been told, that
                    rein-deer, wolves, foxes, beavers, and stone-rams, every where abounded in the
                    forests of this country; and they had promised themselves great sport in
                    pursuing them; but after staying out full two days and nights, during which time
                    they had been exposed to several severe storms, they returned much fatigued,
                    without having been able to kill a single creature. The parties who had been
                    sent out to wood and water had succeeded much better. As soon as the ships were
                    ready to launch, they were ready to compleat the hold. In short, the utmost
                    dispatch was made to hasten our departure, so that by the latter end of
                    September <pb n="349"/> we were in readiness to put to sea. The cattle with
                    which we were now supplied, one would have thought, had dropt from another
                    region, It is among the wonders of nature, with what celerity every vegetable
                    and every animal changes its appearance in this climate.</p>
                <p>On the 12th of June, when we left the harbour of Kamshatska, the spring had but
                    just begun to announce the approach of summer, by the budding of the trees, and
                    the springing of the grass; but now, on our return, it was matter of surprize to
                    find the fruits ripe, and the harvest in full perfection. The cattle were mere
                    skin and bone, which we were glad to accept at first coming; but those that were
                    now sent us were fine and fat, and would have made no bad figure in
                    Smithfield-market. The grass was in many places as high as our knees, and the
                    corn, where any grew, bore the promising appearance of a fine crop. In short,
                    from the most dreary, barren, and desolate aspect, that any habitable country
                    could present, this was become one of the most delightful. Mr. Nelson reaped a
                    rich harvest of rare plants, and had the additional pleasure of gathering them
                    in their most exalted state.</p>
                <p>In this interval of idle time, between compleating our repairs and clearing the
                    harbour, we had leisure to take a view of the town near the shore, where we
                    first moored, and that of Paratounka, where the priest lived, and where the
                    church was situated. These towns have received some improvement since they
                    became subject to the Rus+sians, but are still most wretched dwellings. The
                    houses are built (if we may call that building, which is half dug out of the
                    earth, and half 〈◊〉 upon poles) in two different forms, one for their <pb
                        n="350"/> summer, and the other for their winter residence.</p>
                <p>Their winter habitation is made by digging a square hole in the earth, about five
                    or six feet deep, the length and breadth being proportioned to the number of
                    people that are to live in it. At each corner of this square hole they set up a
                    thick post, and in the intermediate space between these corner posts, they place
                    other posts at certain distances, and over these they lay balks, fastening them
                    together with strong cords, which they make of nettles prepared in the manner of
                    hemp. Across these they place other balks, in the manner of a bridge, then cover
                    the whole with thatch, leaving a square opening in the middle, which serves at
                    once for door, window, and chimney. On one side of this square is their
                    fire-place, and on the opposite side is ranged their kitchen-furniture. On the
                    two other sides are a kind of broad benches made with earth, on which each
                    family lie, and in one of these huts or houses there live several families. To
                    enter these huts by the only opening at top, they use a ladder, not made with
                    rounds between two sides, like ours, but consisting only of narrow slips of wood
                    fastened to a plank. This ladder the women mount with great agility, with
                    children at their backs; and though the smoke would blind and suffocate those
                    who are not used to it, yet the Kamshatskadales find no inconvenience from
                    it.</p>
                <p>Their summer huts, called balagans, are made by fixing up posts about fourteen
                    feet above ground, and laying balks over them as before. On these they make a
                    floor, and then raise a roof, which they thatch with grass. To these balagans
                    they have two doors, which they ascend by the same kind of ladder.</p>
                <pb n="351"/>
                <p>In the winter they use the balagans for magazines, the thatch secures what they
                    lay up in them from rain, and by taking away the ladder, it becomes
                    inaccessible to wild beasts and vermin.</p>
                <p>It being summer, we had no access to their winter dwellings, which were all shut
                    up, and they were not over fond of exposing their poverty; for though they have
                    little to boast of, they are not without pride. The whole furniture of the
                    commonality consists of dishes, bowls, troughs, and cans; their cans are made of
                    birch bark, their other utensils of wood, which till the Russians introduced
                    iron among them, they hollowed with instruments made of stone or bone; but with
                    these tools their work was tedious and difficult. In these bowls they dress
                    their food, though, being wood, they will not bear the fire.</p>
                <p>In the winter the men are employed in hunting, making sledges, and fetching wood;
                    and the women in weaving nets, and spinning thread.</p>
                <p>In the spring the rivers begin to thaw, and the fish that wintered in them to go
                    towards the sea; the men therefore in this season are busied in fishing, and the
                    women in curing what they catch.</p>
                <p>They chiefly catch the salmon, which are very plenty and very delicious, by
                    spearing, at which they are as aukward as at shooting.</p>
                <p>In the summer the men build both their winter and summer huts, train their dogs,
                    and make their houshold utensils and warlike instruments; but the women make all
                    the clothing, even to the shoes. Their clothes, for the most part, are made of
                    the skins of land and sea-animals, particularly deer, dogs, and seals; but
                    sometimes they use the skins of birds, and frequently those of different
                    animals in the same garments. They commonly <pb n="352"/> wear two coats; the
                    under one with the hair inwards, and the upper one with the hair outwards. The
                    women have besides, an under garment, not unlike Dutch trowsers, divided and
                    drawn round the knees with strings.</p>
                <p>They are filthy beyond imagination. They never wash their hands or faces, nor
                    pare their nails. They eat out of the same dish with the dogs, which they never
                    wash. Both men and women plait their hair in two locks, which they never comb;
                    and those who have short hair, supply the locks with false. This is said of the
                    Kamshatskadales, who live more to the North; those in the towns which we saw,
                    had learnt of the Russians to be more cleanly.</p>
                <p>They are very superstitious: and the women in particular pretend to avert
                    misfortunes, cure diseases, and foretel future events, by muttering
                    incantations over the fins of fishes, mingled with a certain herb, which they
                    gather from the woods with much labour. They pretend also to judge of good and
                    bad fortune, by the lines of the hands, and by their dreams, which they relate
                    to each other as soon as they awake. They dread going near the burning
                    mountains, lest the invisible beings that inhabit them should hurt them; and
                    think it a sin to drink or to bathe in the hot springs, with which their country
                    abounds, because they suppose those springs to be heated by the evil spirits
                    that produce them. They are said never to bury their dead; but, binding a strap
                    round the neck of the corpse, drag it to the next forest, where they leave it to
                    be eaten by the bears, wolves, or other wild inhabitants. They have a notion
                    that they who are eaten with dogs will drive with fine dogs in another world.
                    They throw away all the <pb n="353"/> clothes of the deceased, because they
                    believe that they who wear them will die before their time.</p>
                <p>The country is said to abound with wild beasts, which constitute the principal
                    riches of the inhabitants; particularly foxes, sables, stone-foxes, and hares,
                    marmots, ermins, weasles, bears, wolves, rein-deer, and stone-rams; but our
                    gentlemen were much disappointed, who went in pursuit of them. The only game
                    they killed was a she-bear, though they diverted themselves in hunting with the
                    natives for several days: nor were they much more successful in shooting; even
                    the sea-fowl were hardly to be come at, they were so watchful. They have a
                    species of weasle, called the glutton, whose fur is so much more esteemed than
                    all others, that they say the good spirits are clothed with it. The paws of this
                    animal are white as snow, but the hair of the body is yellow. Sixty rubles
                    (about 12 guineas nearly) have been given for a skin, and a sea-beaver for a
                    single paw.</p>
                <p>Of the bears, the inhabitants make good use; of their skins they make their beds,
                    coverings, caps, collars, and gloves; and of their flesh and fat, their most
                    delicious food; but their manner of hunting them, is attended with much danger
                    and little profit. They watch their haunts, and follow their tracks to the lakes
                    where they resort. They then choose some convenient place to conceal
                    themselves, to be in readiness to watch their prey. They then plant their rests
                    (for no Kamtshatskadale ever shoots without a rest) and when the bear comes
                    within distance, they point their guns, and let fly. If they kill or maim, so
                    that the bear cannot pursue, 'tis well; but if they miss, as they frequently do,
                    'tis happy for the hunter if he escapes. The enraged beast makes at the place
                    whence the report is heard, and, if <pb n="354"/> not received on the hunter's
                    spear, which he always has in reserve, the combat becomes so unequal, that the
                    bear is generally the conqueror.</p>
                <p> The Kamshatskadales, all along the Northern coasts, have a particular manner of
                    dressing their food, which is the very reverse of that of the Indians in the
                    South. There they roast or stew with stones made hot and buried, as it were, in
                    the earth with their meat, by which its relish is said to be much improved. But
                    here they boil it with hot stones immersed in water, by which its flavour is
                    rendered more insipid. The same necessity, however, seems to have pointed out
                    the same means to the people of the torrid and the frigid zones; for both being
                    equally unacquainted with iron, and wood being incapable of resisting fire, when
                    brought in contact with it, though the principle was obvious, the application
                    was difficult; those, therefore, of the torrid zone, would naturally be led to
                    call the warmth of the earth to their aid; whilst those in the frozen climates,
                    would think water a more ready assistant: add to this, that the colder regions
                    abound with hot springs; some in Kamshatska, in particular, are so hot, as to
                    approach nearly to the degree of boiling water; but these they think it sinful
                    to use, as we have already observed.</p>
                <p>The dogs of this country are like our village curs, and are of different colours.
                    They feed chiefly on fish; and their masters use them, instead of horses or
                    rein-deer, to draw sledges.</p>
                <p>The seas and lakes abound with a variety of amphibious animals, of which seals
                    and sea-horses and sea-cows, are the most numerous and the most profitable. Of
                    the skins of the seal they make their canoes, and on their flesh and fat they
                    feed <pb n="355"/> deliciously. Whales are sometimes cast upon the shores, but
                    very seldom, unless wounded.</p>
                <p>With the teeth and bones of the sea-horse and sea-cow, they point their arrows
                    and weapons of war; and of their fat and blubber they make their oil. They have
                    otters in their lakes, but their skins bear a great price.</p>
                <p>They have birds of various kinds in great abundance. Among the sea-fowl, they
                    have the puffin, the sea-crow, the Greenland pigeon, and the cormorant. They
                    have swans, geese, and eleven species of ducks; and they have plovers, snipes,
                    and small birds without number. They have likewise four kinds of eagles; the
                    black eagle, with a white head; the white eagle; the spotted eagle, and the
                    brown eagle. They have vultures also, and hawks innumerable.</p>
                <p>This country swarms with insects in the summer, which are very troublesome; but
                    they have neither frog, toad, nor serpent. Lizards are not rare; but they
                    believe these creatures to be spies, sent from the infernal powers to inspect
                    their lives and foretel their deaths; and therefore whenever they see one, they
                    kill it, and cut it into small pieces, that it may not carry back any
                    intelligence to their hurt.</p>
                <p>But what is most remarkable, and deserves the attention of the curious, is the
                    general conformity between the Kamshatskadales towards the East, and of the
                    Americans, that live on the opposite coast, just over against them, in their
                    persons, habits, customs, and food; both dress exactly in the same manner; both
                    cut holes in their faces in the manner already described, in which they put
                    bones like false teeth, by way of ornament; and both make their canoes exactly
                    on the same construction. These are about twelve feet long and two <pb n="356"
                    /> broad, sharp at the head and stern, and flat at the bottom; they consist of
                    flat pieces of wood, joined at both ends, and kept apart in the middle by a
                    transverse piece, through which there is a round hole, just large enough for the
                    man to insert his legs, and to seat himself on a bench made on purpose; this
                    skeleton is covered with seal-skin, dyed of a kind of purple colour, and the
                    whole is skirted with loose skin, which, when the man is seated, he draws close
                    round him, like the mouth of a purse; and, with a coat and a cap of the same
                    skin, which covers his whole body, makes the man and his boat appear like one
                    piece; and thus clad, and thus seated and surrounded, he fears neither the
                    roughest sea, nor the severest weather. But here it is necessary to distinguish
                    between the native Kamshatskadales and the Russians who live at Kamtshatska,
                    who preserve the Russian language and the Russian manners.</p>
                <p>And now we have had occasion to mention this similiarity between the inhabitants
                    on the opposite shores of Asia and America, we shall embrace this opportunity
                    to correct a very material error in our account of our last year's voyage,
                    where, speaking of the Russian Discoveries, we took notice, after examining
                    Beering's Straits, though the Russians supposed that the lands were parted, here
                    we found the continent to join, by which the Reader will, no doubt, imagine,
                    that we have asserted, that the two continents of Asia and America join, which
                    they do not; but are separated by a strait between two promontories, which in
                    clear weather are so near as to be seen in sailing through with the naked eye.
                    But what is meant is this. When Beering made his discovery, in coasting along
                    the American shore, he discovered a sound or strait, which having surmounted,
                        <pb n="357"/> he found himself in a great bay, which he imagined was another
                    sea; and that the land which he had passed was not the American continent, but
                    a great island separated from the continent by the sound or strait just
                    mentioned. This sound therefore, and this bay, we examined; and sound that what
                    the Russians had mistaken for an island, is actually a part of the American
                    continent. Hence it appears, that notwithstanding all that was written against
                    it, Beering is justly entitled to the honour of having discovered all that part
                    of the N. W. continent of America that has been hitherto marked in our maps as
                    parts unknown.</p>
                <p>It remains now only to give a short description of the bay and harbour where we
                    repaired, which at the entrance is between two very high bluff rocks. On the
                    starboard as we enter is the light-house, of which mention has already been
                    made; and at the distance of about twenty miles the volcano, from whence flames
                    and ashes are sometimes emitted; and these eruptions are carried by the wind to
                    a great distance, and to the great terror of the inhabitants. The bay is about
                    eight leagues deep, and lies from S. E. to N. W. and from N. E. to S. W. it is
                    about four leagues. It is inaccessible during the winter, by reason of the ice,
                    but very safe and convenient during the summer. There are in it three excellent
                    harbours.</p>
                <p>The harbour where we lay to careen and repair, would contain about twenty ships
                    of the line in perfect safety, being closely surrounded with high hills, except
                    at the entrance. The people are civil, and in their way very obliging; but their
                    manner of living affords nothing very enchanting for sailors.</p>
                <pb n="358"/>
                <p>Our ships being now in as good repair as we had reason to expect from the length
                    of the voyage they had passed, the rigorous weather to which they had been
                    exposed, the boisterous seas they had shipped, and, above all, from the violent
                    concussions of the ice that had shaken their very frames, and had stript them
                    of their sheathing: and being likewise plentifully provided with provisions and
                    stores, by the generosity of her Imperial Majesty of Russia, and by the care
                    and benevolence of her Governors and officers.</p>
                <p>On the 9th of October, 1779, we weighed, and soon were without the light-house,
                    shaping our course to the southward, and On the 10th were in lat. 52.36. when we
                    had a dead calm, and went to fishing for cod, with good success. Thermometer
                    52.</p>
                <p>On the 11th we pursued our course, and by noon were in lat. 51.1.</p>
                <p>On the 12th we stood S. W. and at night sounded at sixty-two fathom, having in
                    the afternoon passed three small islands to the westward of us, and Cape
                    Lopatka, the southernmost extremity of Kamtshatska. Lat. 50.19. Thermometer
                    48.52½.</p>
                <p>On the 13th we were in lat. 50. long. 157. Course as before.</p>
                <p>On the 14th we still continued the same course, full in view, and passed
                    Paramousin, the largest of the Kurile Islands. Lat. 48.30.</p>
                <p>The 15th we altered our course in search of some islands, which the Russians said
                    were inhabited by people of a gigantic size, who were covered with hair; but
                    who notwithstanding were very civil, and would supply us with cattle and hogs,
                    with which their islands abounded. These islands, however, we never found, nor
                    the land of <pb n="359"/> De Gama, though we continued searching for them till
                    The 19th, when a storm came on, and we lost sight of the Discovery; but next day
                    were in company, and resumed our course; the gale continuing till The 22d, when
                    we found ourselves in lat. 41. and long. E. from London 149.20. The wind which
                    had abated in the day, freshened again about nine at night, and soon increased
                    to a gale, when we were obliged to lie-to; as we imagined, from the usual signs
                    and soundings at eighty fathoms, that we must be near land.</p>
                <p>In the morning of the 23d we stood N. N. W. in search of land, but found none. At
                    noon, by double al•. lat 4•.48. long. 146.17. E. About ten at night we altered
                    our course W. N. W. and so continued till The 25th, when we were in lat. 40.18.
                    long. 144.29. E. and continued our course with an easy sail. At three in the
                    afternoon, a large piece of timber passed us to the northward. And On the 26th,
                    early in the morning, the man at the mast-head called out land, distant about
                    seven or eight leagues, bearing E. by N. to N. W. We then found ourselves within
                    sight of Japan. The country is of a moderate heigth, consists of a double chain
                    of mountains, abounds with wood, and has a pleasing appearance, being chequered
                    with hills and vallies, and well stored with houses, villages, and cites. Here
                    being only in ten fathom off the shore, we cast our fishing-lines overboard,
                    but without success. Lat. 40.56. long. E. Thermometer 52.55.</p>
                <p>Early in the morning of the 27th we saw 2 sail, seemingly very large, making
                    towards us from the shore. We cleared ship, and made the signal to <pb n="360"/>
                    the Discovery to do the same. One was a square-rigged vessel, though she had but
                    one mast, appeared to be higher at each end than in the midship, very shor•,
                    and built much in the manner of the Chinese junks. We hoisted English colours.
                    She looked at us, but made sail to the westward, and we continued our
                    course.</p>
                <p>On the 28th we saw land bearing W. N. W. to S. half W. distant about six leagues.
                    We then sounded sixty-four fathom, and stood from S. to S. E. by E. Lat. 38.16.
                    long. 142.10. Thermometer fifty nine and a half.</p>
                <p>On the 29th we again stood S. half W. and in the morning observed another vessel
                    making 〈◊〉 the eastward at a great distance. We again hoisted English colours,
                    but she paid no attention to them, and we pursued our course.</p>
                <p>On the 30th we were in lat. 36.41. steering S. W. Thermometer sixty-four and a
                    half.</p>
                <p>On the 31st saw land very high, from W. half N. to N. W. at a great distance. Saw
                    several birds of a brown plumage hovering about the ships, driven from the land
                    by the storm of light+ning and rain, which blew in heavy squalls.</p>
                <p>November 1st, steered all day from S. to S. W. saw a high mountain, which seemed
                    to be a vol+cano, but at a great distance. Lat. at noon 35. ••. Tacked and stood
                    to the northward.</p>
                <p>On the 2d we again tacked, and stood E. half S. and, finding the water of a milky
                    colour, sounded, but had no ground at 150 fathoms. Lat. 36.30. long. 140.26.
                    Thermometer •• and a half.</p>
                <p>The 3d, the wind ••om the S. S. E. we now continued working to the eastward, to
                    clear the land, but made little way, though a storm came on, which lasted till
                    next day.</p>
                <pb n="361"/>
                <p>The 4th, the wind being against us, we advanced but slowly, being at noon in
                    35.49. only; with a great swell from the S. W. Thermometer 72 and a half.</p>
                <p>The 5th we had only advanced 2 min.</p>
                <p>On the 6th, the wind shifted to the N. E. made sail, and stood all day S. by W.
                    to S. S. W. Lat. 35.15.</p>
                <p>The 7th, the sea all round was covered with pumice stones floating to the
                    Northward, several pieces of which being taken up, weighed from one ounce to
                    three pounds. We now approached the climate where bonettoes, albatrosses,
                    sharks, dolphins, porpusses, and flying-fish are seen to play their frolics.</p>
                <p>On the 8th we saw sea-weed, pieces of timber, great quantities of pumice, and
                    other signs of land; but no land came in fight. At night we shortened sail.</p>
                <p>On the 9th, we stood the whole day S. W. Lat. 32.48. Thermometer 71 and a
                    half.</p>
                <p>The 10th, blew a heavy gale from N. N. W. hauled out wind to N. E. On the 11th,
                    bore away again S. by W. but, the gale increasing towards night, hauled our wind
                    to the Northward.</p>
                <p>The 12th, the gale continued, lay-to, with the ships heads to the Westward.
                    Shipped many heavy seas, and the rain fell in torrents.</p>
                <p>The 13th, the storm abated. Stood S. S. W. all day; we still continued to pass
                    prodigious quantities of pumice-stones, which almost cover the sea between
                    Japan and the Basha Islands, which indicate some great convulsion in nature. Our
                    officers were of opinion, that the Company's land and Staten Island had
                    disappeared in this convulsion; but our philosophers were of another mind. Lat.
                    at noon 25.56. long. 143.18. E.</p>
                <pb n="362"/>
                <p>n the 14th made sail, W. S. W. At 11 A. M. the Discovery made the signal for
                    land, which we answered. It then bore S. W. distant seven or eight leagues, and
                    appeared like a burning mountain, from whence proceeded, as was supposed on
                    better grounds, all the pumice we had seen. In the night saw volumes of flame
                    proceeding from it, very awful.</p>
                <p>On the 15th lost sight of the volcano; but in the evening another made a still
                    more awful appearance, and the volcanic crater was clearly descernible by our
                    glasses on board the ship. This was confirmed, by the strong sulphureous smell
                    which they omitted, as we approached them. To the southernmost, our Captain gave
                    the name of Sulphur Island. Lat. 24.48. long. 141.12. We were now in lat. 24.50.
                    long. 140.20. E. Thermometer 72½.</p>
                <p>On the 16th we bore away W. half S. Wind fresh from E. N. E. At noon found
                    ourselves in lat. 24.25. having, by the variation and setting of the current,
                    gone 20 miles to the Northward. Long. 138.16.20.″ E. Thermometer 75 and a
                    half.</p>
                <p>Early on the 17th, being near the tropic, and expecting the weather to continue
                    fine, we shifted our canvas and running-rigging, and bent our old ones, knowing
                    what we had still to expect before we reached our native shores; and we made the
                    signal for the Discovery to go on our hull-beam in search of land, but found
                    none. Lat. at noon 23.46.</p>
                <p>On the 18th we stood the whole day W. S. W. with a stiff breeze. And On the 19th
                    were in lat. 22.30. The 20th continued our course without any thing
                    material.</p>
                <pb n="363"/>
                <p>The 21st we were in lat. 21.42. a hard gale and heavy rain.</p>
                <p>The 22d we kept our course the whole day. Lat. at noon 20.46.</p>
                <p>The 23d altered our course, and stood W. by S. Lat. 21. long. 123.20.</p>
                <p>The 24th hauled our wind, and stood N. N. W. Hard gale from N. E.</p>
                <p>The 25th the gale increasing, we lay-to, with the ships heads to the Northward.
                    During the night there was an eclipse of the moon, but could not be observed
                    because of the violent rain. At the time of the greatest darkness, a sailor on
                    board the Discovery, in stowing the main top-mast-stay-sail of the Discovery,
                    fell over board; but fortunately laying hold of a rope hanging from the
                    fore-chains into the water, he was got on board, without any other hurt than a
                    slight bruise on one shoulder. Lat. at noon 21.29.</p>
                <p>The 26th we again bore away W. S. W. and so continued all day.</p>
                <p>The 27th continued the same course all day. At night shortened sail, and hauled
                    up to N. N. W.</p>
                <p>Early on the 28th we were surprised by breakers close under our bows. Made the
                    signal to the Discovery, and immediately tacked to the Southward. At seven we
                    wore ship, and again stood to the N. W. At ten saw breakers from N. E. by E. to
                    W. by S. the nearest distant about a mile. We sounded at fifty-four fathom, and
                    bore away W. S. W. keeping a proper distance from the reefs, and coasting along
                    till we passed them. About noon the S. W. end bore from us N. N. W. distant
                    about two miles, lat. 21.30. long. 116.45, the island of Prata distant 3 or 4
                        <pb n="364"/> leagues. We then made sail N. N. W. which course we continued
                    all night.</p>
                <p>On the 29th, about eight, A. M. we came in sight of a whole fleet of small craft,
                    which we took to be fshing-vessels. They were at a great distance, and not one
                    of them left their employment to come near us. Lat. 21.58. We were now only
                    distant from Macao, the port to which we were bound, about twenty-six
                    leagues.</p>
                <p>On the 30th we wore ship, and stood to the Southward, and about eleven in the
                    morning, the man at the mast-head called out, Land, bearing W. ½ S. distant
                    about three leagues. This proved one of the northernmost of the Ladrone Islands.
                    As soon as we came within distance, we fired two guns for a pilot, and one came
                    presently along-side, and our Captain agreed for thirty-five dollars to carry
                    us into Macao.</p>
                <p>December 1st, about two in the afternoon, after a passage of one-and-twenty days,
                    we cast anchor within four miles of the harbour, where we were met by two
                    Chinese gentlemen, who told us of the French war, and of his Majesty's ship the
                    Seahorse having left that place about the time we left Kamshatska. About eight
                    in the evening our boats were manned, and our third Lieutenant went to the
                    English factory there for news, and about ten returned with the magazines and
                    news-papers for 1776, 1777, 1778, being the latest they had received. He
                    likewise brought a confirmation of the French war, and of the continuance of the
                    American war; and that five sail of English ships were now at Vampo, near
                    Canton, in China.</p>
                <p>On the 2d, early in the morning, we made sail, and anchored a-breast of the
                    island, and saluted the Governor with thirteen guns, which were answered <pb
                        n="365"/> with an equal number from the fort. We had scarce dropt anchor,
                    when we were visited by two English gentlemen, who, after learning who we were,
                    and what we had been upon, persuaded the Commodore to leave our then
                    situation, and to moor the ships in a safer birth to the leeward of a small
                    island about two miles distant, where they might remain without danger.</p>
                <p>It was now three years since we had been in any port, where we could converse any
                    otherwise than by signs; and before any one was suffered to go ashore, the
                    Commodore called all hands aft, and ordered them to deliver up their journals,
                    and every writing, remark, or memorandum that any of them had made of any
                    particular respecting the voyage, on pain of the severest punishment in case
                    of concealment, in order that all those journals, writings, remarks, or
                    memorandums, respecting the voyage, might be sealed up, and directed to the
                    Lords of the Admiralty. At the same time requiring that every chart of the
                    coasts, or of any part of any of the coasts where we had been, or draught of any
                    thing curious might be delivered up in like manner, in order to accompany the
                    journals, &amp;c. all which was complied with; and the papers were made up and
                    sealed accordingly in sight of the whole crew, the papers of the commissioned
                    officers by themselves, the papers of the non-commissioned officers by
                    themselves, and the papers of the marines and common men by themselves. The
                    boats were then ordered out, and sent to Macao for fresh provisions, which next
                    day were dealt out to the ships companies at full allowance. But before these
                    could return, there came from the town boats with beef, veal, pork, ducks,
                    geese, turnips, carrots, lemons, oranges, and every other <pb n="366"/> article
                    of provisions which the island produced; some as presents to the Captains and
                    officers; but by far the greatest part to make their market.</p>
                <p>Being now safely moored, the first thing that claimed the attention of the
                    Commodore, was to provide as well as he could for the safety of the crews in
                    their return home. The news of a French war, without letting us know at the same
                    time the order issued by the French king in our favour, gave us much concern.
                    Our ships were ill fitted for war; the decks fore and aft being finished flush,
                    had no covering for men or officers; it was therefore thought necessary to
                    strengthen the stanchions and rails, and to raise a kind of parapet,
                    musket-proof on both decks; and likewise to strengthen the cabins as much as
                    possible, in case of action. And as it was agreed that both ships could carry
                    more guns, if any were to be purchased, the Commodore was for taking the ships
                    to Canton, till persuaded from it by some gentlemen belonging to the English
                    factory, who undertook to negociate the business without giving umbrage to the
                    Chinese, who certainly would, they said, be offended at the appearance of ships
                    of war in their river, and would oppose their progress; reminding him at the
                    same time, of the disagreeable dispute in which Commodore Anson was formerly
                    involved on a similar occasion; and how hurtful it was to the Company's commerce
                    for several years after. Upon these representations the Commodore relinquished
                    his design, and Capt. King, with other officers, were sent in a Company's ship,
                    assisted by one or two gentlemen belonging to the factory, to Canton, to
                    purchase cannon and such other stores as were not to be had at Macao.</p>
                <pb n="367"/>
                <p>On the 18th they set sail, and at the same time two Portuguese vessels from the
                    harbour of Macao, came and anchored close by us. They were bound to Bengal and
                    Madras, and very readily assisted us with ropes for running rigging, some
                    canvas, and with 60 fathom of cable. They likewise exchanged four small cannon
                    and some shot with the Discovery for a spare anchor.</p>
                <p>The 25th, being Christmas-day, was kept, as is usual with English sailors, in
                    jollity and mirth; and what added to the pleasure of the day, there was not a
                    man ill in either ship.</p>
                <p> On the 28th the Commodore received a letter from Capt. King, with an account of
                    the disasters that had happened in the passage, having lost two anchors and
                    their boat, and were several times in danger of running ashore; that they did
                    not arrive at Canton till the 24th; but that he hoped soon to return with the
                    cannon and stores, for which he had bargained, though at a great price.</p>
                <p>Here they learnt that the skins we had brought with us from the N. W. Continent
                    of America, were of nearly double the value at Canton, as at Kamshatska.</p>
                <p>Early on the 29th there came into the harbour of Macao a Spanish galleon from
                    Manilla, said to have more than two millions of treasure on board; and before we
                    left our station, there came in another worth double that sum. We were
                    unacquainted with the Spanish war, or these ships, had we been properly
                    commissioned, might easily have been captured. It is astonishing, that none of
                    our cruisers have ever lain in wait for these ships, as their voyage is annual,
                    and their course known.</p>
                <pb n="368"/>
                <p>The same evening a quarrel happened between a party of our sailors, on shore with
                    leave, and some of the town's people, in which several were dangerously wounded
                    on both sides; and Mr. Burney, first Lieutenant of the Resolution, had a dagger
                    run through his left arm in endeavouring to put an end to the fray. For this
                    insult the Governor sent to demand satisfaction; but upon examination, the
                    town's people were found to be the aggressors. The Governor made a very handsome
                    apology for his mistake, and the affair ended without any serious
                    consequences.</p>
                <p>We were now visited daily by strangers, who came out of curiosity to see ships
                    that had been so many years upon discovery; and every one was anxious to learn
                    what he could concerning our course, but that we were not at liberty to tell
                    them. Among the rest came two French spies, as we imagined; but not being able
                    to make out any thing criminal against them, they were suffered to depart. The
                    suspicion arose from some of our men, who having particularly marked them,
                    insisted that they had formerly sailed with them in the French service. Nothing
                    remarkable till Jan. the 8th, 1780, when Capt. King, with the officers that
                    accompanied him, arrived in the Company's vessel, with the cannon, ammunition,
                    and stores from Canton. These being shipped, nothing remained to be done, but
                    to take on board the live stock which the Commodore and officers had purchased
                    for their own use, and nine head of cattle to be killed at sea for the use of
                    the ship's company; the beef and pork which we brought from England, being now
                    scarce eatable. Provisions of all kinds were here very dear, and very
                    indifferent; but what made us amends, was the <pb n="369"/> price they gave for
                    our furs, on which they set a great value.</p>
                <p>On the 11th of January we unmoored, and the wind being fair, came to sail with a
                    pleasant breeze; but the wind dying away in the evening, we cast anchor; and in
                    the night, John Cave, Quarter-master, and Robert Spencer, ran away with the
                    great cutter.</p>
                <p>And On the 12th, we were the whole day detained in endeavouring to recover them,
                    but to no purpose.</p>
                <p>On the 13th, we passed the fort, and saluted the garrison with 13 four pounders,
                    which they answered with an equal number.</p>
                <p>We had now nothing but a beaten track to pass, in our way to our long wished-for
                    native country.</p>
                <p>On the 20th, we made the little group of islands, known by the name of Pulo
                    Condore, in lat. 8.40. N. at one of which we anchored, and found it inhabited.
                    Here we both wooded and watered, and the carpenters felled some large trees,
                    which were afterwards sawed on board. The trees on these islands are chiefly
                    cedar, iron-wood, mangrove, manchinael, and box. Some nutmeg-trees there were,
                    but of a wild kind, that bear a fruit without taste or smell. In pursuit of
                    game, of which there was plenty, our gentlemen fell in with a party of natives,
                    one of whom accompanied them to the ships. We made him understand that we wanted
                    provisions; and he had not left us long, before a number of boats came round the
                    island, laden with fruits, fowls, ducks, and other provisions, which they
                    readily exchanged for any thing we offered them, though they were not wholly
                    unacquainted with the use of money; for being informed that herds of buffaloes
                    were on the island, we purchased seven; three of them, of a large size, <pb
                        n="370"/> from four to seven dollars each. These were fierce animals, and
                    were not easily brought on board; but after being subdued, were as gentle and
                    tractable as the gentlest of our other cattle. What seems surprising is, that
                    the men on the island dare hardly go near them when loose in the woods; but they
                    will suffer little boys to handle and halter them, which is done by passing a
                    rope through a hole made in their nostrils, and round their horns;
                    notwithstanding which, some of them broke the trees down to which they were
                    fastened. Here we found the cabbage-tree, and other succulent greens, with which
                    our people made very free, without asking questions.</p>
                <p>On the 28th we unmoored; and on The 31st, made the island of Banka; and having
                    passed the Straits, On the 5th of February, we made the island of Sumatra, where
                    we saw a large ship lying at anchor; and On the 7th, passed the island of Java,
                    where we saw two more. We made the signal to the Discovery to prepare for
                    action, and we did the same, hoisting English colours. It was some time before
                    they shewed any, but, at length, they hoisted Dutch colours. We sent our boat on
                    board, and received the first news of a Spanish war. We pursued our course; and
                    On the 11th, we made the island of Cocoterra. Here, from a healthy ship's
                    company, several of our people fell ill of the flux, and so continued for some
                    time; however, having got plenty of good water on board, we sailed On the 13th,
                    directing our course to Prince's island.</p>
                <p>On the 15th, we entered the bay of Prince's island, where Capt. Cook, when he
                    commanded <pb n="371"/> the Endeavour, anchored in his return to Europe. Here we
                    purchased turtles, fowls, and some deer; and here we laid in store of
                    cocoa-nuts, plantains, and other vegetables; and having compleated our stock of
                    water, set sail On the 18th, directing our course for the Cape of Good Hope.
                    Nothing remarkable till The 25th of March, when we were attacked by a severe
                    storm, attended with thunder, lightning and rain, which lasted five days
                    without intermission.</p>
                <p>On the 7th of April, we were alarmed by finding our rudder-head almost twisted
                    off. We got the pendants fixed to steer with tackles, it being the carpenter's
                    opinion it could not last till our arrival at the next port. However, by proper
                    application it lasted till we arrived at the Cape.</p>
                <p>On the 9th, we fell in with Cape Lagullas, where, about nine in the morning, we
                    saw a small vessel cruising, which proved to be the East India Company's snow,
                    Betsey, looking out for the East India fleet. She left England the 5th of
                    November, and False Bay on the 4th instant. She confirmed the account we had
                    received of the Spanish war. We exchanged some trifles, and soon parted.</p>
                <p>And On the 12th, we entered Bay False, came to, and moored the same day, after
                    having saluted the fort with 13 guns, which was answered by the same number. We
                    had scarce dropt anchor, when the Governor came on board, bringing with him a
                    packet of letters for Capt. Cook, which had lain there ever since the beginning
                    of 1779; he had heard of the death of Capt. Cook by a Dutch vessel, and
                    expressed great concern for that unhappy event, asking a thousand questions
                    concerning the particulars.</p>
                <pb n="372"/>
                <p>The first care of our Commodore was to provide for the sick; and by three in the
                    afternoon they were all landed, and sent to the hospital under the care of the
                    Surgeon's mate. All hands were next set to their different employments, some to
                    wood and water, and some to compleat the repairs. These they forwarded with the
                    utmost expedition, every one being eager to get to his native country. Of the
                    repairs, the Resolution's rudder was the most material. The first thing,
                    therefore, to be done, was to unhinge it and get it on shore; and though this
                    was immediately put in hand, it was The 27th before it was restored to its
                    place.</p>
                <p>By the 29th, the fick, who were numerous when we arrived at the Cape, we having
                    16 ill of the flux, were pretty well recovered: the repairs were in forwardness,
                    and the stores ready to be taken on board at a moment's notice, when news was
                    brought us, that an express was arrived at Table Bay from England, in the
                    Sibbald frigate, which had only been ten weeks from Plymouth, and that she was
                    to return again as soon as she had delivered her dispatches. Both Captains went
                    instantly to learn the contents; and, on their return, orders were given to
                    prepare as fast as possible to sail. This was joyful news. The substance of
                    these dispatches related chiefly to the course the East Indiamen were to steer,
                    to fall in with the convoy appointed to meet them; with some instructions for
                    our Commodore, respecting the papers which were to be transmitted to the
                    Admiralty, which were all put on board the frigate; and Mr. Portlock, Master's
                    mate, embarked along with them.</p>
                <p>On the 30th, they set sail; but it was The 7th of May before we were in readiness
                    to follow. About noon, on that day, the signal was <pb n="373"/> made for
                    unmooring. We had now 120 live sheep on board, and the Discovery a like
                    proportion. We had all other provisions in equal plenty, and we had likewise a
                    healthy crew, in high spirits, wishing for nothing but a fair wind to shorten
                    our voyage; but that was not yet to be obtained. We had scarce saluted the
                    garrison on taking leave, when the wind died away, and a great swell ensued,
                    which continued till The 9th, when the snow came in sight, which •e spoke with
                    on the 8th of April. We sent our pinnace for news from sea; but she had seen
                    only 〈◊〉 sail pass since we first spoke with her.</p>
                <p>On the 19th of April, the whole crew were near being blown up, by the Snow's
                    taking fire forwards: the ship was much damaged, and they were putting into the
                    Cape to resit, and then were bound for St. Helena.</p>
                <p>On the 1•th, we made sail, and pursued our course 〈◊〉 without any material
                    occurrence, till The 10th of June, when the Discovery's boat brought us word,
                    that, in ••••…ising the great guns, the carpenter's mate had his arm shattered
                    in a shocking manner, by part of the wadding being left in after a former
                    discharge; another man was slightly wounded at the same time.</p>
                <p>On the 12th, it began to blow very hard, and so continued till next day, when the
                    Discovery sprung her main-top-mast, and we were obliged to lie-to till another
                    was put up.</p>
                <p>On the 13th, we crossed the line to the Northward, and observed a water-spout to
                    the N. W. at no great distance; and for the remainder of the month had fine
                    weather. Thermometer from 80 to 78½.</p>
                <p>July the 1st, we had the Discovery's people on <pb n="374"/> board, to compare
                    time. Lat. at noon, 20. N. long. 34. W.</p>
                <p>On the 13th, the ship's birth-day was celebrated on board, and double allowance
                    given to the whole crew, who were at this time in perfect health.</p>
                <p>On the 27th, at day-light, the Discovery made the signal for seeing a sail. We
                    instantly began to clear ship, in case of an enemy, and hoisted English colours;
                    and, on our near approach, 〈◊〉 sail did the same. She was bound to the
                    Southward, and we pursued our course.</p>
                <p>On the 1st of August, just at sun-set, we saw a sail at a great distance to the
                    Westward, but in the morning she was quite out of sight. We were then in lat.
                    43.56. N.</p>
                <p>On the 7th, we were in lat. 48. long. 10.10. W. a heavy gale, with rain.</p>
                <p>On the 9th, the wind shifted to the Eastward, when we shaped our course to the
                    North of Ire+land. Blew hard all day On the 21st, being then in lat. 59.4. N.
                    long. 9.6. saw a sail standing to the Southward, when we made the Discover•…'s
                    signal to chace; but the gale continuing, could not come near enough to 〈…〉. In
                    the evening, the man at the masthead called out, Land, distant about three
                    leagues.</p>
                <p>〈◊〉 on the 22d, made the signal for a pilot, and at eight o'clock a pilot came
                    off, and by the 〈◊〉 we were safely moored in the harbour 〈◊〉 S•…omness, in the
                    North of Scotland. We were soon visited by the gentlemen in the neighbourhood▪ </p>
                <p>〈◊〉 the 23d, fresh beef and greens were served in 〈…〉 to both ships companies;
                    and the 〈…〉 passengers went on shore, and set out for 〈…〉 The Captains and
                    officers went likewise <pb n="375"/> on shore, and the men had liberty to
                    divert themselves by turns during our stay.</p>
                <p>By the 29th, we had got wood and water enough on board to serve us to London; and
                    at noon, the signal was made to weigh; but the wind coming about, and blowing
                    fresh from the S. E. obliged us not only to relinquish our design for the
                    present, but detained us till the 19th of September.</p>
                <p>On the 20th of September, Capt. King of the Discovery, Mr. Bailey, our
                    astronomer, and Mr. Webber, left the ships, and set out for London; and Mr.
                    Burney, first Lieutenant of the Resolution, took the command of the Discovery in
                    the absence of Capt. King.</p>
                <p>During our stay, the ships were visited by gentlemen from all the islands round;
                    and by the Apollo frigate and her consort: they brought in a prize, valued at
                    10,000l. and both Captains came to visit Capt. Gore, on board the Resolution,
                    who now was taken very ill, and so continued to the end of the voyage. The same
                    afternoon, the wind came round in our favour, when the signal was made for
                    unmooring, and both ships got under way. At night we came to an anchor with the
                    tide.</p>
                <p>On the 23d, Samuel Johnson, Serjeant of marines, died; and next morning his
                    corpse was committed to the deep.</p>
                <p>On the 25th, the wind came again to the Eastward, and continued against us most
                    of our passage.</p>
                <p>On the 28th, we passed by Leith, off which we again spoke with his Majesty's ship
                    Apollo.</p>
                <p>On the 29th, John Davis, Quarter-master, died. Our detension at Stromness proved
                    unfortunate for these two men, who died in their passage.—Had the ships arrived
                    in a direct course, their <pb n="376"/> friends would at least have had the
                    satisfaction of administering all in their power to their recovery, which, to
                    persons who had been so long absent, would have been no small consolation.</p>
                <p>On the 30th, we came to an anchor off Yarmouth, in company with his Majesty's
                    sloops of war, the Fly and Alderney. Our boats were immediately sent on shore
                    for provisions; and for a spare cable for our small bower, that we had being
                    near worn out. We lay here till The 2d of October, when we weighed, and
                    sailed.</p>
                <p>On the 4th, we came to at the Nore. And On the 6th, dropt our anchors at
                    Deptford, having been absent just four years, three months, and two days.</p>
